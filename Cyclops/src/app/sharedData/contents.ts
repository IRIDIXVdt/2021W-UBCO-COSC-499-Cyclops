        article: 'Changing the way we interact with nature is essential to avoid further climate change and biodiversity loss – but there’s more to it than that. Transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones helps secure a stable future, by ensuring that everything we do, we can do forever.'

        article: 'While the next few sections of ‘Laying the Foundation’ are focused on energy, it’s important to understand that polluting energy sources are just one part of the problem. We’ll go over numerous examples in the main sections – but for now, just remember that it’s not only about how we produce energy – it’s also about what we use it for.'

        article: 'In 2018, food systems accounted for roughly 33% of our global GHG emissions [note that many reports have more cautious estimates, like the IPCC’s 21-37% range]. Unsurprisingly, the farming stage – where crops or animals are grown – is responsible for the majority of our food system’s emissions.'

        article: 'Household appliances are often sneaky energy consumers, far less scrutinized than HVAC systems. It’s important to understand that anything that heats, cools, lights up, or moves needs energy. For the residential sector, most of that energy is supplied in the form of electricity or natural gas.'
