                segmentTitle: "Climate Change",
                segmentBody: `<p>Climate change is not something that occurs overnight.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere consists of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon – and just <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">0.04</a>% carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>]. In this section, we&#8217;ll see how this ridiculously small percentage of CO<sub>2</sub>, along with other greenhouse gases [GHGs] in the atmosphere, can have remarkable consequences at the global scale.</p>
                <h5 id="the-earth-s-energy-balance">The Earth&#8217;s Energy Balance</h5>
                <p><em>For the following section, think of radiation as energy or heat contained in a ray of light.</em></p>
                <p>The Sun emits light as shortwave radiation. The Earth heats as it absorbs some of that radiation, before sending a portion of that back towards space as longwave radiation. Unfortunately, the longwave type of radiation can be absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. These gases then re-emit this energy in all directions. Here&#8217;s the issue: the energy that was supposed to be sent back to space is now partially redirected towards the Earth&#8217;s surface – which effectively traps heat in our atmosphere.</p>
                <p>What we&#8217;ve just explained here is the famous greenhouse effect, where heat is trapped in our atmosphere by the likes of CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. This effect has been taking place since our atmosphere formed billions of years ago and has played an important role in keeping the Earth warm, but now it&#8217;s making it a tad too hot – way too fast. We&#8217;ve recently released GHGs in the atmosphere in such quantities that the previously stable energy balance is now tilted in favor of heating the Earth.</p>
                <h5 id="global-warming-and-climate-change"><strong>Global Warming and Climate Change</strong></h5>
                <p>By now, we hope you&#8217;ve guessed the consequence of the greenhouse effect: global warming. All the additional heat trapped in our atmosphere has been increasing our average global temperature. In fact, during the 2011-2020 period, global surface temperatures had increased by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">1.09</a>°C compared to the 1850-1900 period. This shows once again that global warming is real and it began well over a century ago.  </p>
                <p><strong>GHGs</strong></p>
                <p>Scientific consensus is <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">very clear</a> that the atmosphere&#8217;s GHG content has been increasing rapidly because of human activity. Since 1750, atmospheric concentrations have risen by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">47</a>% for CO<sub>2</sub>, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">156</a>% for methane [CH<sub>4</sub>], and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">23</a>% for nitrous oxide [N<sub>2</sub>O]. In 2019, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were higher than at any point in the past <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">2</a> million years, and we&#8217;ve emitted more CO<sub>2</sub> since. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are far more GHGs than just CO<sub>2</sub> – and much more powerful ones too. For equal emissions [by mass], CO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a> times less greenhousy than methane and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/quantification-guidance/global-warming-potentials.html">22,800</a> times less greenhousy than sulfur hexafluoride [&#8216;greenhousy&#8217; describes the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">global warming potential</a> of a gas – here, taken over 100 years]. However, we&#8217;ve been producing so much more CO<sub>2</sub> in the past few centuries that it&#8217;s still the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">largest</a> contributor to global warming, with methane not too far behind. </p>
                <p><strong>From Global Warming to Climate Change</strong></p>
                <p>The Earth&#8217;s atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are 2 major reasons that our climates are the way they are. They play extremely critical roles in the global water and carbon cycles, dictate precipitation patterns, and help shape many of the world&#8217;s oceanic current systems. Unfortunately, that means that any slight variations in temperature can have devastating consequences at the global scale – notably by changing many climates at once. </p>
                <p>Climate change literally means changes in climate patterns and events. Cyclones, storm surges, heat waves, droughts, and extreme precipitations are all destructive climate events that are occurring more frequently and/or more intensely as a result of global warming. </p>
                <p>For example, global warming increases the atmosphere&#8217;s capacity to hold water vapor. In turn, this can cause more/bigger clouds to form, which can lead to more intense precipitation events [potentially causing floods]. This corroborates the projection that extreme daily precipitation events will intensify by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">7</a>% for every +1°C of global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]. That may not sound significant, but we have to keep in mind that long-term global temperatures are projected to reach +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">3.3-5.7</a>°C under the &#8220;very high GHG emissions scenario&#8221;. So all the 7% intensifications can add up real fast if emissions aren&#8217;t curbed soon. </p>
                <p>Alas it&#8217;s even worse than that. Global warming and climate change are driving many long-term &#8216;irreversible&#8217; effects that will have significant consequences worldwide. In particular, the IPCC has outlined the following points:</p>
                <ul><li>Mountain and polar glaciers are projected to continue <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> for decades or centuries. Even if we were to drastically reduce our emissions in the coming decades [to limit warming to +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.5</span></a>°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century], the Arctic would still be likely to experience <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">at least one</span></a> sea ice free summer before 2050. And unsurprisingly, uncontrolled emissions in the near future would lead to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">far more occurrences</span></a> of sea ice free summers in the Arctic.</li><li>GHGs contained in permafrost [i.e. grounds that are completely frozen] will irreversibly be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">released</span></a> into the atmosphere during permafrost thaw, at centennial timescales. Preventing permafrost thaw as much as possible by reducing our emissions will be key to reduce the amount of GHGs released by the environment. Otherwise, reaching the &#8216;tipping point&#8217; for permafrost will induce more global warming, which can establish negative feedback loops [i.e. vicious circles] that end up causing even more irreversible damage.</li><li>The Greenland Ice Sheet will keep <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> and the Antarctic Ice Sheet will <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">likely</span></a> do the same, although the total amount of ice loss remains to be seen. In Greenland, total ice loss will be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">heavily influenced</span></a> by the amount of GHGs we emit in the next few decades [there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of evidence that would suggest the same is true for Antarctica, for now at least].</li><li>Sea level will continue to rise for <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">hundreds to thousands</span></a> of years, after which it will maintain its elevation for additional <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">thousands of years</span></a>. Over the next 2000 years for example, the average global sea level is expected to rise by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-3</span></a> meters if we limit global warming to +1.5°C, by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-6</span></a> meters with a +2°C limit, or by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">19-22</span></a> meters at +5°C [i.e. temperature reached in 2100]. And there&#8217;s a very real <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">possibility</span></a> that sea levels continue to rise after those 2000 years have passed, especially if we keep increasing the amount of GHGs we release every year. In the short term, the average global sea level rise will likely be contained between <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">0.28-2</span></a> meters by 2100, depending on if we limit warming to +1.5°C or if we keep growing it to +5°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li></ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are too many consequences to global warming and climate change to list them all here. However, a few of them can help us understand how humans will be directly impacted by these changes – notably by threatening global food and water security, increasing the likeliness and intensity of extreme weather events, and forcing climate migration on <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36248">hundreds of millions</a> of individuals around the globe [among many more consequences].</p>
                <p>Sadly, many indirect effects will also drastically impact human lives, like biodiversity loss. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate Feedbacks</strong></p>
                <p>Global warming isn&#8217;t all due to GHG emissions, at least not directly. Interestingly, climate change has its own impacts on the Earth&#8217;s energy balance, known as &#8216;climate feedbacks&#8217;. We&#8217;ve seen a few examples of climate feedbacks already – between the release of permafrost GHGs, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers [which reflect radiation back toward space], and the increasing concentrations of water vapor in the atmosphere [a potent GHG]. In these examples of positive climate feedbacks, initial warming causes climate change, which itself amplifies the initial warming – which then induces additional climate change. </p>
                <h5 id="climate-vs-weather"><strong>Climate vs. Weather</strong></h5>
                <p>It&#8217;s important to note that global warming and climate change don&#8217;t imply that every day will be hotter than the last. Weather is not the same as climate. Weather describes short term events and temperatures that don&#8217;t really mean anything on their own – since weather is subject to internal and natural variability [i.e. a certain level of randomness]. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, climate is pretty much just weather averaged out over longer periods of time. As such, climate change is responsible for increasing the likeliness of extreme weather events – but can&#8217;t guarantee that they will take place at any given moment. Similarly, a single record-breaking temperature could not confirm climate change is real, nor could a freezing temperature refute it. </p>
                <p>That being said, when year after year we measure record-breaking daily, weekly, monthly, and annual temperatures [or extreme weather events] in very different parts of the world, it becomes pretty clear that global warming and climate change are already here. It&#8217;s no longer the future generation&#8217;s problem.</p>`

                segmentTitle: "Bidodiversity Loss",
                segmentBody: `<p>Biodiversity loss may not get as much attention as climate change does, but it&#8217;s just as bad. Biodiversity can be defined in a number of ways. Here, we&#8217;ll define it as the grouping of the genetic, species, and ecosystem diversities all into one. As we&#8217;ll see in this section, these 3 types of diversities are all interconnected and interdependent.</p>
                <h5>Genetic Diversity</h5>
                <p>Genetic diversity describes the total number of genetic variations that a species has in its gene pool. For an example of a genetic variation, think of the human gene that determines eye color, where variations can range from black to blue, or even light gray. Strong genetic diversity is driven by numerous different genetic variations that are &#8216;mixed&#8217; together during reproduction. With greater gene pools, the odds that 2 mating individuals will have different genetic codes is higher. Strong genetic diversity within a species is closely related to their strength and ability to survive.&nbsp; As a counterexample, think of 2 siblings that reproduce [whose genetic code is very similar], their children have a higher risk of being born with disabilities.</p>
                <p>With more diverse individuals, the species will adapt better to their ever-evolving environment, making the species stronger as a whole.</p>
                <h5>Species Diversity</h5>
                <p>Species diversity is self-explanatory. A higher number of different animals and plants leads to greater species diversity. One easy way to show the importance of species diversity is with the food chain. We all know at least one example of the &#8216;ladder&#8217; that features the ultimate predators [like a lion] at the top and the defenseless prey [like grass] at the bottom. Each species feeds on the ladder step below itself – but would not survive without it. </p>
                <p>Strong species diversity implies that a predator will not have to depend on a single prey. Instead, the predator will have multiple options that can satisfy its diet. This way, when the population of one of the prey species lowers, the predator will predate more on the other sources of food due to the prey&#8217;s rareness [not a conscious choice, just statistical]. Contrarily, if a prey species threatens to become invasive due to an increase in population size, predators are more likely to feed on it. This provides balance within the ecosystem as it regulates and limits each species&#8217; demography – ensuring that resources aren&#8217;t over-exploited by a single species. A balanced and diverse ecosystem is a strong ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Where a weak ecosystem&#8217;s food chain is dependent on each ladder step, a strong ecosystem can be visualized as multiple ladders side-by-side. If a ladder step is weakened, you can always rely on the other steps next to it.</p>
                <h5>Ecosystem Diversity</h5>
                <p>Ecosystem diversity is extremely important as well and its effects are easier to visualize than for the previous two.</p>
                <p>An ecosystem is a natural environment in which plants, animals, and their surroundings coexist in balance. Many different ecosystems exist around the world, and they all help regulate the Earth. Jungles, deserts, glaciers, savannahs, reefs, prairies, oceans, and many more all have unique characteristics that literally make the world a better place. Jungles and forests for example, play an essential role in the water and carbon cycles. Deserts and glaciers may seem like uninhabitable wastes of space, but they help regulate the Earth&#8217;s temperature with their reflectiveness. Oceans don&#8217;t reflect much, but they do help mitigate global warming by absorbing a <a href="https://href.li/?https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">quarter</a> of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every year.</p>
                <p>Maintaining our diverse ecosystems around the globe is essential if we are to preserve our remaining natural environments and the life they contain, improve yields, limit global warming, mitigate the effects of climate change, and more. If it had to be summed up in a single sentence: biodiversity helps improve/preserve anything that involves the natural world – which we depend on heavily. </p>
                <h5><strong>Threats</strong></h5>
                <p>Biodiversity is beautiful and balanced – but fragile. 5 major causes of biodiversity loss are a direct result of human activity, following the acronym <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">H.I.C.O.P.</a>:</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat loss</strong> describes the physical deterioration or &#8216;shrinking&#8217; of a species&#8217; environment. Affected species are seeing huge declines in their population size, and many are forced to migrate quickly into other ecosystems all at once, significantly unbalancing it. This can cause invasive species.</p>
                <p><strong>Invasive species</strong> are characterized as such when a single species starts dominating an ecosystem. This considerably weakens ecosystems as it does not allow species diversity or balance. They are especially a problem when foreign species integrate a new environment and start outcompeting native species, as the native species are often crucial for ensuring ecosystem balance. Invasive species can occur naturally, but are often a consequence of human activity because of a rapid change in their environment. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate change</strong> describes the change in the climate due to human activity. Since you&#8217;ve made it this far, we&#8217;re going to assume you know what we&#8217;re talking about. Climate change can seriously affect biodiversity, as it threatens species that depend on a stable climate pattern. The list of such species isn&#8217;t limited to polar bears and penguins – species all around the world have adapted to a very specific climate. An abrupt change in the climate [like the one we&#8217;re seeing now] severely endangers all species as they do not have time to adapt to different living conditions in such a short amount of time.</p>
                <p><strong>Overharvesting</strong> describes the excessive and destructive tendency we have to hunt species faster than they can procreate, or grow crops faster than soil can heal. It takes no expert to see that this leads to extinction of animal species and degradation of croplands. This human characteristic isn&#8217;t new or unheard of. With examples ranging from the wooly mammoth to the dodo bird, humans haven&#8217;t always shown their long-term thinking capabilities. As species go extinct and soil fertility drops, biodiversity levels decrease and entire ecosystems weaken.</p>
                <p><strong>Pollution</strong> describes the contamination of any environment that results in nature degradation. Air, water, soil, and noise. These don&#8217;t describe <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">The Last Airbender</a>&#8216;s 4 nations, these are all serious types of pollution. Toxicity present in the first 3 elements directly endangers species – especially those that live near sources of pollution. Often overlooked, noise pollution also impacts nearby species, since some of them rely on their hearing for survival and mating calls. It&#8217;s not just near cities either. Pollution can occur in remote parts of the world where biodiversity is strong, as shown by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Pollution significantly weakens ecosystems as both its species and their environment are damaged simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>`

                segmentTitle: "",
                segmentBody: `<p>Changing the way we interact with nature is essential to avoid further climate change and biodiversity loss – but there&#8217;s more to it than that. Transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones helps secure a stable future, by ensuring that everything we do, we can do forever. </p>
            <h5><strong>Infinite Growth in a Finite World</strong></h5>
            <p>We live in economies that require growth for our societies to function. As the backbone of our economies, companies are drivers of growth. A successful company will expand and hire more employees, leading to growth in the society. The quest for growth is the main reason that companies are always innovating and integrating new markets. If they don&#8217;t and instead stay stagnant with their current products and customers, another company with newer products will leave them in the dust [similarly, financial growth requires that &#8220;your money should be making more money&#8221; with investments – another continuous increase]. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, maintaining growth isn&#8217;t an easy task. And doing so forever in a finite world constrained by limited resources– well that&#8217;s simply impossible. We&#8217;ll touch more on that later.</p>
            <h5><strong>Resources and Innovation </strong></h5>
            <p>Thinking about our surrounding objects in terms of how many resources they&#8217;ve consumed can change the way you see the world. The new smartwatch launched today sure looks small, but its components have a massive footprint. Those mahogany kitchen cabinets? Same thing. Unless you live in the woods butt naked, everything around you has had a negative impact on the environment.</p>
            <p>Innovating at the expense of the environment is understandable when it means lifting populations out of poverty and increasing quality of life. However, nowadays most innovations don&#8217;t help people make ends meet. Instead, they target people who already have enough, with newer [and often useless] products that help them accomplish tasks a fraction of a second faster, or automatically. Must we really deplete more of the world&#8217;s resources to avoid something as simple as flipping a light switch?</p>
            <p>Although innovation has and will continue to lead to fantastic advances where it matters, like medical brain-scanning devices or vaccines, we have to remember that everything has a cost. As we try to reduce our global impacts on the environment, it&#8217;ll be our responsibility to determine which inventions are worth extracting/polluting for – and which ones are just profit-seeking wastes of resources. </p>
            <h5><strong>Adapting to a Declining Economy in a Sustainable Future</strong></h5>
            <p>As we&#8217;ve stated a few times, our economies are built on growth. Unfortunately, developed countries are just that – developed. Modern economic growth relies on infinite resources and population, but that&#8217;s obviously not realistic. We can&#8217;t open more markets once we&#8217;ve already achieved full globalization, and combining that with limited resources and declining population growth, we get a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG">declining</a> GDP growth rate [gross domestic product &#8211; more on that below] – which will eventually result in a declining GDP [once the growth rate reaches the negatives]. That sounds bad, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Not all economic systems have to depend on growth.</p>
            <p>With a good transition plan in place, we&#8217;ll be just fine. Given the time, we can surely develop more sustainable employment opportunities for everyone, no matter the level of education. For example, in the future – we&#8217;ll need more factory workers to make insulator material, engineers to design better water management systems, and coders to develop tools to evaluate energy efficiency [and much more]. So there&#8217;s room for everyone.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s without the transition plan that it gets a bit trickier. We won&#8217;t attempt to predict the future here, but we&#8217;ll note a few important things:</p>
            <ol><li>Our planet&#8217;s resources are finite, which means that businesses that rely on the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources will fail in the long term [in other words, if we can&#8217;t do something forever, then at some point we&#8217;ll have to stop]. There&#8217;s no getting around that. </li><li>Governments that are unprepared will – by definition – not be ready to change. Unfortunately, creating the right conditions for a sustainable transition takes time. Consequently, if we wait and don&#8217;t come up with a plan soon, we&#8217;re effectively telling workers in unsustainable industries that their eventual unemployment [see 1.] doesn&#8217;t matter.</li><li>When large chunks of the population are unemployed at the same time [see 1.], shit happens. If history repeats itself, then that either takes the form of direct violence, political extremism, or clashes between different ethnic groups. </li></ol>
            <p>So it&#8217;d be best if we started the transition to a more sustainable society sooner rather than later. On top of just being the logical thing to do based on the arguments presented above, it would also help us reduce our impacts on the environment before it&#8217;s too late. </p>
            <h5><strong>What now</strong></h5>
            <p>Where should we focus our efforts to reduce our impacts on the planet as efficiently as possible? For many individuals trying to get more familiar with the environmental crisis and its solutions, this is the million-dollar question. In essence, it amounts to asking: who&#8217;s responsible for the situation we&#8217;re in, and what can the culprits do differently? </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, neither individuals, companies, nor governments can be blamed for 100% of the global warming or biodiversity loss that has occurred to date. That&#8217;s too bad – it could have made our job of fixing this mess a whole lot easier. Instead, it&#8217;s pretty clear that all 3 parties contributed in their own ways to the progressive release of GHG emissions and destruction of natural habitats. </p>
            <p>Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that certain companies and governments are off the hook for purposefully slowing down environmental action and interfering with the scientific community – something that&#8217;s still very common today. It simply means that individuals have also had a negative impact on the planet, and it&#8217;s important to understand that. </p>
            <p>However, it&#8217;s hard to say whether that means individuals share some of the responsibility of where we&#8217;re at with the environment today. For the longest time, nobody had a clue that there was a problem. And when many of us recently realized that there was, climate change and biodiversity loss had already become systemic issues, deeply engrained in our societies. </p>
            <p>As such, to mitigate both climate change and biodiversity loss, solutions first and foremost have to come from governments and companies to affect change at large scales. For individuals, there are personalized solutions that can help us reduce our impacts on the environment – and we&#8217;ll see plenty in later sections – but it&#8217;s important to note that our efforts would be much more useful if aimed toward uprooting the unsustainable practices that our current systems rely on. </p>
            <p>At the same time, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that some of our habits are purely unsustainable – no matter how careful we are. In those instances, truly eco-friendly [as opposed to people-pleasing] governments will have to pass strong regulations to ensure those habits change, for the better of the planet. Unfortunately, there can be significant pushback on these types of policies, as the individual liberty of having unsustainable habits is lost. </p>
            <p>People-pleasing governments that don&#8217;t pass such policies, on the other hand, end up taking far less risks. And as the term &#8216;people-pleasing&#8217; indicates, they&#8217;ll likely have better odds of reelection. That&#8217;s not something politicians can ignore. Sadly though, they&#8217;ll achieve far less meaningful change this way  – which simply isn&#8217;t an option with the crisis at hand. </p>
            <p>As such, to answer the question asked above: the most important thing individuals can do is voice their support for policies, to let governments know that they&#8217;ll be okay with the consequences. CyclopediApp&#8217;s next version will provide a plethora of resources for individuals to easily influence large scale decision-making.</p>
            <h5>Where to Start</h5>
            <p>To prevent unemployment and population unrest, governments have to step up and put more emphasis on the performance indicators that matter. The GDP is an outdated metric that doesn&#8217;t track what actually affects populations and fails to capture the environmental losses resulting from pollution and extraction. </p>
            <p>As such, governments should &#8220;<a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">stop directing our economic system to the search for maximum growth and to constant increase in the gross national product.</a>&#8221; Instead, they&#8217;d be better off evaluating <a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">happiness</a>, education rates, natural stability, and of course employment rates [e.g. <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">HDI</a>, WDI, PQLI, etc&#8230;]. <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/making-peace-nature">Switching</a> from the GDP to these metrics will help our societies track stability and sustainability – which will help us focus our efforts there. </p>
            <p>As we go along and point out weaknesses in the current economic system, it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t suggest throwing the entire capitalist system in the trash. However, it&#8217;s also essential to realize that capitalism relies on certain unrealistic assumptions for it to &#8216;work&#8217;, like the quest for infinite growth we&#8217;ve mentioned a few times already. Capitalism was defined with a set of rules several centuries ago, so we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of tweaking things that clearly aren&#8217;t possible as we go. It would be mighty unfair of us to expect that the early developers of capitalism could predict the future and the environmental crisis. After all, capitalism prides itself on innovation – it only seems fair to invent new rules for the system itself.</p>
            <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Adapting to a more sustainable economic model will be essential. Not only because the current unsustainable model can&#8217;t go on forever, but also because it&#8217;s an opportunity to drastically reduce unemployment, conflicts, and the destruction of our natural systems around the world.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we&#8217;ll have to voice our support for policies that can affect change at the larger scales – while being ready to adapt to more sustainable lifestyles. CyclopediApp will help with that.</p>`
