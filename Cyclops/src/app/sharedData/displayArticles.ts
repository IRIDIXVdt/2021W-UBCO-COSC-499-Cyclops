                segmentTitle: "Climate Change",
                segmentBody: `<p>Climate change is not something that occurs overnight.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere consists of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon – and just <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">0.04</a>% carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>]. In this section, we&#8217;ll see how this ridiculously small percentage of CO<sub>2</sub>, along with other greenhouse gases [GHGs] in the atmosphere, can have remarkable consequences at the global scale.</p>
                <h5 id="the-earth-s-energy-balance">The Earth&#8217;s Energy Balance</h5>
                <p><em>For the following section, think of radiation as energy or heat contained in a ray of light.</em></p>
                <p>The Sun emits light as shortwave radiation. The Earth heats as it absorbs some of that radiation, before sending a portion of that back towards space as longwave radiation. Unfortunately, the longwave type of radiation can be absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. These gases then re-emit this energy in all directions. Here&#8217;s the issue: the energy that was supposed to be sent back to space is now partially redirected towards the Earth&#8217;s surface – which effectively traps heat in our atmosphere.</p>
                <p>What we&#8217;ve just explained here is the famous greenhouse effect, where heat is trapped in our atmosphere by the likes of CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. This effect has been taking place since our atmosphere formed billions of years ago and has played an important role in keeping the Earth warm, but now it&#8217;s making it a tad too hot – way too fast. We&#8217;ve recently released GHGs in the atmosphere in such quantities that the previously stable energy balance is now tilted in favor of heating the Earth.</p>
                <h5 id="global-warming-and-climate-change"><strong>Global Warming and Climate Change</strong></h5>
                <p>By now, we hope you&#8217;ve guessed the consequence of the greenhouse effect: global warming. All the additional heat trapped in our atmosphere has been increasing our average global temperature. In fact, during the 2011-2020 period, global surface temperatures had increased by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">1.09</a>°C compared to the 1850-1900 period. This shows once again that global warming is real and it began well over a century ago.  </p>
                <p><strong>GHGs</strong></p>
                <p>Scientific consensus is <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">very clear</a> that the atmosphere&#8217;s GHG content has been increasing rapidly because of human activity. Since 1750, atmospheric concentrations have risen by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">47</a>% for CO<sub>2</sub>, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">156</a>% for methane [CH<sub>4</sub>], and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">23</a>% for nitrous oxide [N<sub>2</sub>O]. In 2019, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were higher than at any point in the past <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">2</a> million years, and we&#8217;ve emitted more CO<sub>2</sub> since. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are far more GHGs than just CO<sub>2</sub> – and much more powerful ones too. For equal emissions [by mass], CO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a> times less greenhousy than methane and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/quantification-guidance/global-warming-potentials.html">22,800</a> times less greenhousy than sulfur hexafluoride [&#8216;greenhousy&#8217; describes the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">global warming potential</a> of a gas – here, taken over 100 years]. However, we&#8217;ve been producing so much more CO<sub>2</sub> in the past few centuries that it&#8217;s still the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">largest</a> contributor to global warming, with methane not too far behind. </p>
                <p><strong>From Global Warming to Climate Change</strong></p>
                <p>The Earth&#8217;s atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are 2 major reasons that our climates are the way they are. They play extremely critical roles in the global water and carbon cycles, dictate precipitation patterns, and help shape many of the world&#8217;s oceanic current systems. Unfortunately, that means that any slight variations in temperature can have devastating consequences at the global scale – notably by changing many climates at once. </p>
                <p>Climate change literally means changes in climate patterns and events. Cyclones, storm surges, heat waves, droughts, and extreme precipitations are all destructive climate events that are occurring more frequently and/or more intensely as a result of global warming. </p>
                <p>For example, global warming increases the atmosphere&#8217;s capacity to hold water vapor. In turn, this can cause more/bigger clouds to form, which can lead to more intense precipitation events [potentially causing floods]. This corroborates the projection that extreme daily precipitation events will intensify by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">7</a>% for every +1°C of global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]. That may not sound significant, but we have to keep in mind that long-term global temperatures are projected to reach +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">3.3-5.7</a>°C under the &#8220;very high GHG emissions scenario&#8221;. So all the 7% intensifications can add up real fast if emissions aren&#8217;t curbed soon. </p>
                <p>Alas it&#8217;s even worse than that. Global warming and climate change are driving many long-term &#8216;irreversible&#8217; effects that will have significant consequences worldwide. In particular, the IPCC has outlined the following points:</p>
                <ul><li>Mountain and polar glaciers are projected to continue <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> for decades or centuries. Even if we were to drastically reduce our emissions in the coming decades [to limit warming to +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.5</span></a>°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century], the Arctic would still be likely to experience <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">at least one</span></a> sea ice free summer before 2050. And unsurprisingly, uncontrolled emissions in the near future would lead to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">far more occurrences</span></a> of sea ice free summers in the Arctic.</li><li>GHGs contained in permafrost [i.e. grounds that are completely frozen] will irreversibly be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">released</span></a> into the atmosphere during permafrost thaw, at centennial timescales. Preventing permafrost thaw as much as possible by reducing our emissions will be key to reduce the amount of GHGs released by the environment. Otherwise, reaching the &#8216;tipping point&#8217; for permafrost will induce more global warming, which can establish negative feedback loops [i.e. vicious circles] that end up causing even more irreversible damage.</li><li>The Greenland Ice Sheet will keep <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> and the Antarctic Ice Sheet will <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">likely</span></a> do the same, although the total amount of ice loss remains to be seen. In Greenland, total ice loss will be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">heavily influenced</span></a> by the amount of GHGs we emit in the next few decades [there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of evidence that would suggest the same is true for Antarctica, for now at least].</li><li>Sea level will continue to rise for <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">hundreds to thousands</span></a> of years, after which it will maintain its elevation for additional <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">thousands of years</span></a>. Over the next 2000 years for example, the average global sea level is expected to rise by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-3</span></a> meters if we limit global warming to +1.5°C, by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-6</span></a> meters with a +2°C limit, or by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">19-22</span></a> meters at +5°C [i.e. temperature reached in 2100]. And there&#8217;s a very real <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">possibility</span></a> that sea levels continue to rise after those 2000 years have passed, especially if we keep increasing the amount of GHGs we release every year. In the short term, the average global sea level rise will likely be contained between <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">0.28-2</span></a> meters by 2100, depending on if we limit warming to +1.5°C or if we keep growing it to +5°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li></ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are too many consequences to global warming and climate change to list them all here. However, a few of them can help us understand how humans will be directly impacted by these changes – notably by threatening global food and water security, increasing the likeliness and intensity of extreme weather events, and forcing climate migration on <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36248">hundreds of millions</a> of individuals around the globe [among many more consequences].</p>
                <p>Sadly, many indirect effects will also drastically impact human lives, like biodiversity loss. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate Feedbacks</strong></p>
                <p>Global warming isn&#8217;t all due to GHG emissions, at least not directly. Interestingly, climate change has its own impacts on the Earth&#8217;s energy balance, known as &#8216;climate feedbacks&#8217;. We&#8217;ve seen a few examples of climate feedbacks already – between the release of permafrost GHGs, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers [which reflect radiation back toward space], and the increasing concentrations of water vapor in the atmosphere [a potent GHG]. In these examples of positive climate feedbacks, initial warming causes climate change, which itself amplifies the initial warming – which then induces additional climate change. </p>
                <h5 id="climate-vs-weather"><strong>Climate vs. Weather</strong></h5>
                <p>It&#8217;s important to note that global warming and climate change don&#8217;t imply that every day will be hotter than the last. Weather is not the same as climate. Weather describes short term events and temperatures that don&#8217;t really mean anything on their own – since weather is subject to internal and natural variability [i.e. a certain level of randomness]. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, climate is pretty much just weather averaged out over longer periods of time. As such, climate change is responsible for increasing the likeliness of extreme weather events – but can&#8217;t guarantee that they will take place at any given moment. Similarly, a single record-breaking temperature could not confirm climate change is real, nor could a freezing temperature refute it. </p>
                <p>That being said, when year after year we measure record-breaking daily, weekly, monthly, and annual temperatures [or extreme weather events] in very different parts of the world, it becomes pretty clear that global warming and climate change are already here. It&#8217;s no longer the future generation&#8217;s problem.</p>`

                segmentTitle: "Bidodiversity Loss",
                segmentBody: `<p>Biodiversity loss may not get as much attention as climate change does, but it&#8217;s just as bad. Biodiversity can be defined in a number of ways. Here, we&#8217;ll define it as the grouping of the genetic, species, and ecosystem diversities all into one. As we&#8217;ll see in this section, these 3 types of diversities are all interconnected and interdependent.</p>
                <h5>Genetic Diversity</h5>
                <p>Genetic diversity describes the total number of genetic variations that a species has in its gene pool. For an example of a genetic variation, think of the human gene that determines eye color, where variations can range from black to blue, or even light gray. Strong genetic diversity is driven by numerous different genetic variations that are &#8216;mixed&#8217; together during reproduction. With greater gene pools, the odds that 2 mating individuals will have different genetic codes is higher. Strong genetic diversity within a species is closely related to their strength and ability to survive.&nbsp; As a counterexample, think of 2 siblings that reproduce [whose genetic code is very similar], their children have a higher risk of being born with disabilities.</p>
                <p>With more diverse individuals, the species will adapt better to their ever-evolving environment, making the species stronger as a whole.</p>
                <h5>Species Diversity</h5>
                <p>Species diversity is self-explanatory. A higher number of different animals and plants leads to greater species diversity. One easy way to show the importance of species diversity is with the food chain. We all know at least one example of the &#8216;ladder&#8217; that features the ultimate predators [like a lion] at the top and the defenseless prey [like grass] at the bottom. Each species feeds on the ladder step below itself – but would not survive without it. </p>
                <p>Strong species diversity implies that a predator will not have to depend on a single prey. Instead, the predator will have multiple options that can satisfy its diet. This way, when the population of one of the prey species lowers, the predator will predate more on the other sources of food due to the prey&#8217;s rareness [not a conscious choice, just statistical]. Contrarily, if a prey species threatens to become invasive due to an increase in population size, predators are more likely to feed on it. This provides balance within the ecosystem as it regulates and limits each species&#8217; demography – ensuring that resources aren&#8217;t over-exploited by a single species. A balanced and diverse ecosystem is a strong ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Where a weak ecosystem&#8217;s food chain is dependent on each ladder step, a strong ecosystem can be visualized as multiple ladders side-by-side. If a ladder step is weakened, you can always rely on the other steps next to it.</p>
                <h5>Ecosystem Diversity</h5>
                <p>Ecosystem diversity is extremely important as well and its effects are easier to visualize than for the previous two.</p>
                <p>An ecosystem is a natural environment in which plants, animals, and their surroundings coexist in balance. Many different ecosystems exist around the world, and they all help regulate the Earth. Jungles, deserts, glaciers, savannahs, reefs, prairies, oceans, and many more all have unique characteristics that literally make the world a better place. Jungles and forests for example, play an essential role in the water and carbon cycles. Deserts and glaciers may seem like uninhabitable wastes of space, but they help regulate the Earth&#8217;s temperature with their reflectiveness. Oceans don&#8217;t reflect much, but they do help mitigate global warming by absorbing a <a href="https://href.li/?https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">quarter</a> of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every year.</p>
                <p>Maintaining our diverse ecosystems around the globe is essential if we are to preserve our remaining natural environments and the life they contain, improve yields, limit global warming, mitigate the effects of climate change, and more. If it had to be summed up in a single sentence: biodiversity helps improve/preserve anything that involves the natural world – which we depend on heavily. </p>
                <h5><strong>Threats</strong></h5>
                <p>Biodiversity is beautiful and balanced – but fragile. 5 major causes of biodiversity loss are a direct result of human activity, following the acronym <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">H.I.C.O.P.</a>:</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat loss</strong> describes the physical deterioration or &#8216;shrinking&#8217; of a species&#8217; environment. Affected species are seeing huge declines in their population size, and many are forced to migrate quickly into other ecosystems all at once, significantly unbalancing it. This can cause invasive species.</p>
                <p><strong>Invasive species</strong> are characterized as such when a single species starts dominating an ecosystem. This considerably weakens ecosystems as it does not allow species diversity or balance. They are especially a problem when foreign species integrate a new environment and start outcompeting native species, as the native species are often crucial for ensuring ecosystem balance. Invasive species can occur naturally, but are often a consequence of human activity because of a rapid change in their environment. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate change</strong> describes the change in the climate due to human activity. Since you&#8217;ve made it this far, we&#8217;re going to assume you know what we&#8217;re talking about. Climate change can seriously affect biodiversity, as it threatens species that depend on a stable climate pattern. The list of such species isn&#8217;t limited to polar bears and penguins – species all around the world have adapted to a very specific climate. An abrupt change in the climate [like the one we&#8217;re seeing now] severely endangers all species as they do not have time to adapt to different living conditions in such a short amount of time.</p>
                <p><strong>Overharvesting</strong> describes the excessive and destructive tendency we have to hunt species faster than they can procreate, or grow crops faster than soil can heal. It takes no expert to see that this leads to extinction of animal species and degradation of croplands. This human characteristic isn&#8217;t new or unheard of. With examples ranging from the wooly mammoth to the dodo bird, humans haven&#8217;t always shown their long-term thinking capabilities. As species go extinct and soil fertility drops, biodiversity levels decrease and entire ecosystems weaken.</p>
                <p><strong>Pollution</strong> describes the contamination of any environment that results in nature degradation. Air, water, soil, and noise. These don&#8217;t describe <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">The Last Airbender</a>&#8216;s 4 nations, these are all serious types of pollution. Toxicity present in the first 3 elements directly endangers species – especially those that live near sources of pollution. Often overlooked, noise pollution also impacts nearby species, since some of them rely on their hearing for survival and mating calls. It&#8217;s not just near cities either. Pollution can occur in remote parts of the world where biodiversity is strong, as shown by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Pollution significantly weakens ecosystems as both its species and their environment are damaged simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>`

                segmentBody: `<p>Changing the way we interact with nature is essential to avoid further climate change and biodiversity loss – but there&#8217;s more to it than that. Transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones helps secure a stable future, by ensuring that everything we do, we can do forever. </p>
            <h5><strong>Infinite Growth in a Finite World</strong></h5>
            <p>We live in economies that require growth for our societies to function. As the backbone of our economies, companies are drivers of growth. A successful company will expand and hire more employees, leading to growth in the society. The quest for growth is the main reason that companies are always innovating and integrating new markets. If they don&#8217;t and instead stay stagnant with their current products and customers, another company with newer products will leave them in the dust [similarly, financial growth requires that &#8220;your money should be making more money&#8221; with investments – another continuous increase]. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, maintaining growth isn&#8217;t an easy task. And doing so forever in a finite world constrained by limited resources– well that&#8217;s simply impossible. We&#8217;ll touch more on that later.</p>
            <h5><strong>Resources and Innovation </strong></h5>
            <p>Thinking about our surrounding objects in terms of how many resources they&#8217;ve consumed can change the way you see the world. The new smartwatch launched today sure looks small, but its components have a massive footprint. Those mahogany kitchen cabinets? Same thing. Unless you live in the woods butt naked, everything around you has had a negative impact on the environment.</p>
            <p>Innovating at the expense of the environment is understandable when it means lifting populations out of poverty and increasing quality of life. However, nowadays most innovations don&#8217;t help people make ends meet. Instead, they target people who already have enough, with newer [and often useless] products that help them accomplish tasks a fraction of a second faster, or automatically. Must we really deplete more of the world&#8217;s resources to avoid something as simple as flipping a light switch?</p>
            <p>Although innovation has and will continue to lead to fantastic advances where it matters, like medical brain-scanning devices or vaccines, we have to remember that everything has a cost. As we try to reduce our global impacts on the environment, it&#8217;ll be our responsibility to determine which inventions are worth extracting/polluting for – and which ones are just profit-seeking wastes of resources. </p>
            <h5><strong>Adapting to a Declining Economy in a Sustainable Future</strong></h5>
            <p>As we&#8217;ve stated a few times, our economies are built on growth. Unfortunately, developed countries are just that – developed. Modern economic growth relies on infinite resources and population, but that&#8217;s obviously not realistic. We can&#8217;t open more markets once we&#8217;ve already achieved full globalization, and combining that with limited resources and declining population growth, we get a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG">declining</a> GDP growth rate [gross domestic product &#8211; more on that below] – which will eventually result in a declining GDP [once the growth rate reaches the negatives]. That sounds bad, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Not all economic systems have to depend on growth.</p>
            <p>With a good transition plan in place, we&#8217;ll be just fine. Given the time, we can surely develop more sustainable employment opportunities for everyone, no matter the level of education. For example, in the future – we&#8217;ll need more factory workers to make insulator material, engineers to design better water management systems, and coders to develop tools to evaluate energy efficiency [and much more]. So there&#8217;s room for everyone.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s without the transition plan that it gets a bit trickier. We won&#8217;t attempt to predict the future here, but we&#8217;ll note a few important things:</p>
            <ol><li>Our planet&#8217;s resources are finite, which means that businesses that rely on the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources will fail in the long term [in other words, if we can&#8217;t do something forever, then at some point we&#8217;ll have to stop]. There&#8217;s no getting around that. </li><li>Governments that are unprepared will – by definition – not be ready to change. Unfortunately, creating the right conditions for a sustainable transition takes time. Consequently, if we wait and don&#8217;t come up with a plan soon, we&#8217;re effectively telling workers in unsustainable industries that their eventual unemployment [see 1.] doesn&#8217;t matter.</li><li>When large chunks of the population are unemployed at the same time [see 1.], shit happens. If history repeats itself, then that either takes the form of direct violence, political extremism, or clashes between different ethnic groups. </li></ol>
            <p>So it&#8217;d be best if we started the transition to a more sustainable society sooner rather than later. On top of just being the logical thing to do based on the arguments presented above, it would also help us reduce our impacts on the environment before it&#8217;s too late. </p>
            <h5><strong>What now</strong></h5>
            <p>Where should we focus our efforts to reduce our impacts on the planet as efficiently as possible? For many individuals trying to get more familiar with the environmental crisis and its solutions, this is the million-dollar question. In essence, it amounts to asking: who&#8217;s responsible for the situation we&#8217;re in, and what can the culprits do differently? </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, neither individuals, companies, nor governments can be blamed for 100% of the global warming or biodiversity loss that has occurred to date. That&#8217;s too bad – it could have made our job of fixing this mess a whole lot easier. Instead, it&#8217;s pretty clear that all 3 parties contributed in their own ways to the progressive release of GHG emissions and destruction of natural habitats. </p>
            <p>Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that certain companies and governments are off the hook for purposefully slowing down environmental action and interfering with the scientific community – something that&#8217;s still very common today. It simply means that individuals have also had a negative impact on the planet, and it&#8217;s important to understand that. </p>
            <p>However, it&#8217;s hard to say whether that means individuals share some of the responsibility of where we&#8217;re at with the environment today. For the longest time, nobody had a clue that there was a problem. And when many of us recently realized that there was, climate change and biodiversity loss had already become systemic issues, deeply engrained in our societies. </p>
            <p>As such, to mitigate both climate change and biodiversity loss, solutions first and foremost have to come from governments and companies to affect change at large scales. For individuals, there are personalized solutions that can help us reduce our impacts on the environment – and we&#8217;ll see plenty in later sections – but it&#8217;s important to note that our efforts would be much more useful if aimed toward uprooting the unsustainable practices that our current systems rely on. </p>
            <p>At the same time, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that some of our habits are purely unsustainable – no matter how careful we are. In those instances, truly eco-friendly [as opposed to people-pleasing] governments will have to pass strong regulations to ensure those habits change, for the better of the planet. Unfortunately, there can be significant pushback on these types of policies, as the individual liberty of having unsustainable habits is lost. </p>
            <p>People-pleasing governments that don&#8217;t pass such policies, on the other hand, end up taking far less risks. And as the term &#8216;people-pleasing&#8217; indicates, they&#8217;ll likely have better odds of reelection. That&#8217;s not something politicians can ignore. Sadly though, they&#8217;ll achieve far less meaningful change this way  – which simply isn&#8217;t an option with the crisis at hand. </p>
            <p>As such, to answer the question asked above: the most important thing individuals can do is voice their support for policies, to let governments know that they&#8217;ll be okay with the consequences. CyclopediApp&#8217;s next version will provide a plethora of resources for individuals to easily influence large scale decision-making.</p>
            <h5>Where to Start</h5>
            <p>To prevent unemployment and population unrest, governments have to step up and put more emphasis on the performance indicators that matter. The GDP is an outdated metric that doesn&#8217;t track what actually affects populations and fails to capture the environmental losses resulting from pollution and extraction. </p>
            <p>As such, governments should &#8220;<a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">stop directing our economic system to the search for maximum growth and to constant increase in the gross national product.</a>&#8221; Instead, they&#8217;d be better off evaluating <a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">happiness</a>, education rates, natural stability, and of course employment rates [e.g. <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">HDI</a>, WDI, PQLI, etc&#8230;]. <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/making-peace-nature">Switching</a> from the GDP to these metrics will help our societies track stability and sustainability – which will help us focus our efforts there. </p>
            <p>As we go along and point out weaknesses in the current economic system, it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t suggest throwing the entire capitalist system in the trash. However, it&#8217;s also essential to realize that capitalism relies on certain unrealistic assumptions for it to &#8216;work&#8217;, like the quest for infinite growth we&#8217;ve mentioned a few times already. Capitalism was defined with a set of rules several centuries ago, so we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of tweaking things that clearly aren&#8217;t possible as we go. It would be mighty unfair of us to expect that the early developers of capitalism could predict the future and the environmental crisis. After all, capitalism prides itself on innovation – it only seems fair to invent new rules for the system itself.</p>
            <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Adapting to a more sustainable economic model will be essential. Not only because the current unsustainable model can&#8217;t go on forever, but also because it&#8217;s an opportunity to drastically reduce unemployment, conflicts, and the destruction of our natural systems around the world.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we&#8217;ll have to voice our support for policies that can affect change at the larger scales – while being ready to adapt to more sustainable lifestyles. CyclopediApp will help with that.</p>`

Cities are no strangers to such pollution, as there are over 1 billion cars on the road that burn fossil fuels every day and decrease urban air quality. Biodiversity is also affected by the air, water, and soil pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. It&#8217;s extremely important that we prevent such contamination, since what harms the environment directly threatens humans.</p>
            <p>Fossil fuels are dominating the global energy and electricity mixes – and it seems as though that will remain the case in the near future. Although a few local electricity mixes are practically fossil-fuel-free, they usually aren&#8217;t examples that the rest of the world can follow. Additionally, electricity only represents around a fifth of energy consumption worldwide, so we can&#8217;t just focus on electricity mixes if we intend on significantly reducing our emissions.</p>

We&#8217;ll go over numerous examples in the main sections – but for now, just remember that it&#8217;s not only about how we produce energy – it&#8217;s also about what we use it for. </em></p>
            <h5 id="energy"><strong>Energy</strong></h5>
            <p>Everything needs energy. We need energy to get up on a Monday morning. Plants need energy to grow. Even our tectonic plates need energy to move. These are all intangibles, we will always need food, plants will always need sunlight, and the plates will keep moving as long as the Earth&#8217;s core remains a radioactive heat ball. </p>
            <p>If we look around, we&#8217;ll notice other things like our electronics, ovens, light bulbs, beds, or walls. These are all things that needed energy to be manufactured, and some still require a continuous flow of energy during use, like TVs. Since we produce and use so many material objects every day, it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that energy production is a major issue worldwide.  </p>
            <h5 id="fossil-fuels">Fossil Fuels</h5>
            <p>Fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas that are burned daily to produce energy. We burn these specific fuels because they have high energy densities, meaning that we can extract a large amount of energy in a small amount of fuel. Combusting them releases that energy as heat, which we harness in different ways depending on the application.</p>
            <p>When fossil fuels are burned, CO<sub>2</sub> is produced in large amounts. As we&#8217;ve seen, continuously producing this much CO<sub>2</sub> leads to global warming and climate change. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Fossil fuels can also emit other polluting gases, like NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>x</sub> gases, fine particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, or even mercury. These pollutants then contaminate the surrounding environment, although good pollution control processes can make sure the most harmful pollutants are treated. And while some fossil fuels emit less than others once burned, the bottom line remains that they all pollute too much.</p>
            <h5 id="largest-fossil-fuel-burners"><strong>Largest Fossil Fuel Burners</strong></h5>
            <p>There are over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/">1</a> billion miniaturized-fossil-fuel-burning machines on the road every day. Additionally, electricity production at power plants often relies on fossil fuels [as we&#8217;ll see below]. Lastly, industries aren&#8217;t limited to a supply of electricity from power plants, so many of them choose to burn fossil fuels on-site instead. That means there are loads of industrial-sized factories powered by their own fossil-fueled power plants. Between vehicles, the grid&#8217;s power plants, and industry– we continue to burn fossil fuels at an incredible rate.</p>
            <p>While pollution control regulations are in place in developed countries, other regions of the world aren&#8217;t so lucky. And although developed countries have gotten quite good at controlling toxic emissions, we don&#8217;t have many pollution control solutions in place for CO<sub>2</sub>. In fact, it&#8217;s sometimes the product of a control process [e.g. methane flaring]. Automobiles also don&#8217;t have sufficient pollution control. These little machines zoom around town, polluting densely populated areas from within.</p>
            <p>Biodiversity is being significantly damaged because of fossil fuel combustion as well. Even though we can&#8217;t notice most of them, toxic pollutants released during combustion are present in nearby air, water, and soil – and threaten everyone who depends on breathing, drinking, or eating to survive. These pollutants also cause acid rain, ocean acidification, and eutrophication [which we&#8217;ll see in later sections].</p>
            <p>Since we care almost exclusively about what affects us, we&#8217;ll say it again: if our biodiversity falls, so do we.</p>
            <h5 id="energy-and-electricity-mixes"><strong>Energy and Electricity Mixes</strong></h5>
            <p>An &#8216;energy mix&#8217; describes the mix of different energy sources used by a given organization/region. All energy sources hold a specific percentage of the total mix which represents the share of energy produced by the fuel. All sources should add up to 100%. These days, there&#8217;s lots of talk about the newest renewable energy projects and how they&#8217;re pushing fossil fuels out of our energy mix. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not even close to being true at a global scale.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the &#8216;Big 3&#8217; fossil fuels accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2020">81.3</a>% of global energy production. Note that natural gas is far from being eco-friendly, as the name could suggest. It&#8217;s mostly methane [CH<sub>4</sub>], and burning it releases loads of CO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants – although it&#8217;s still less polluting than coal.</p>

            <p>It&#8217;s important to understand the difference between energy and electricity as we go along. Electricity is a form of energy, but energy doesn&#8217;t have to be electricity. For instance, energy can include the natural gas burned to heat homes, a car&#8217;s combusted gasoline, and electricity. </p>
            <p>Electricity isn&#8217;t something we extract from nature, which is why it&#8217;s considered a secondary source of energy. Worldwide, around <a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/2ee82a9c68cd84e572c9db09cc43d7ec3e3fafe7/shell-world-energy-model.pdf">18</a>% of energy is in the form of electricity. Note that &#8216;power&#8217; is often used interchangeably with &#8216;energy&#8217;, although power actually denotes the rate at which energy is generated or consumed [i.e. high-power consuming appliances aren&#8217;t high-energy consuming if they&#8217;re only plugged in for a small amount of time].</p>
            <p>To produce electricity, we can use fossil fuels, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, or many types of renewables. Since electricity is produced by a blend of sources, we can evaluate an electricity mix – which describes the share of primary sources of energy used to produce electricity. Unfortunately, the global electricity mix is also dominated by fossil fuels, although some very rare regions of the world rely almost entirely on renewables like hydropower or geothermal for electricity production [both depend on local conditions, they&#8217;re not an example that the rest of the world can easily follow].</p>
            <p>In 2019, the world&#8217;s electricity mix was dominated by the Big 3 [really just 2 though], accounting for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% of the mix. </p>

            <p>To generate electricity in large quantities, fossil fuels are burned to heat a fluid, which then turns to steam. The steam rotates a turbine, and this motion is then converted to electricity to power homes, buildings, and factories if they&#8217;re connected to the grid. Some fossil-fueled power plants find slightly different methods to rotate the turbines [e.g. using different fluids or &#8216;big car engines&#8217;], but that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t really matter since they all have roughly the same effects.</p>
            <p>The energy source used <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">varies</a> greatly depending on the sector. For example, it makes sense that the transport sector is dominated by oil. It makes sense that the residential sector is dominated by electricity and natural gas. The graph below gives us a general idea of which energy sources are used in each sector [in developed countries]. However, it doesn&#8217;t show which sectors are the most energy intensive, nor how polluting each source is. We&#8217;ll find that out in later sections.</p>

            <p>The 3 Rs are the general rules we need to follow to reduce our impacts on the environment. </p>
            <p>Reducing our resource and energy consumption is essential to mitigate further climate change and biodiversity loss. Reducing by design and improving product quality will be key for companies to reduce their impacts. For individuals, only purchasing necessities is by far the most effective way to reduce our dependence on the natural world. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we have to stop buying products completely.</p>
            <p>Reuse is key to lower production and waste, while making sure individuals can still enjoy a certain item. As such, it&#8217;s crucial for necessities to be reusable so that we can decrease our impacts on the environment. Companies have an important role to play to encourage the reuse of their products, as they have the reach to set up effective reuse programs. Reuse can be extended to include second-hand purchases on items that weren&#8217;t specifically designed to last multiple uses. As a rule of thumb, it&#8217;s typically safe to assume that reusable items are cheaper for individuals and their wallets in the long run.</p>
            <p>Recycling is without a doubt the most integrated R in our societies, but we&#8217;re not particularly good at it. Efficient recycling systems can help mitigate further resource extraction and energy consumption, but they can&#8217;t phase out the whole production stage like the first 2 Rs can. In addition, recycling has plenty of challenges to overcome before it can take a more meaningful role at the global scale, such as triage, material blends, efficiency, increasing material demand, recycling education, limited recycling cycles, and uncollected waste. </p>
            <p>We can’t reach a 100% circular economy. However, using the 3 Rs simultaneously, we can get as close as possible. On top of reducing waste, this will help us avoid unnecessary resource extraction and energy consumption.</p>
            `

            <p>The 3 &#8216;R&#8217;s are the general rules we need to follow to reduce our impacts on the environment, at any scale. We&#8217;ll see in other sections that these rules are central pillars to lowering consumption across all sectors of our societies.</p>
            <h5 id="reduce"><strong>Reduce</strong></h5>
            <p>This is the most important of the 3 Rs. Reducing our energy consumption and dependence on material objects directly reduces our environmental impacts. For companies, this means producing higher quality items that can be used for longer. As we&#8217;ll see later in this section, higher quality products can encourage reuse. The first R can also mean reducing the amount of packaging needed for a specific product, or even designing the packaging in such a way that it can be reused or recycled. That&#8217;s called reducing by design.</p>
            <p>For individuals, reducing means reducing consumption, above all else. Not purchasing a product helps avoid its production, use, and disposal impacts. That is, if companies don&#8217;t wastefully overproduce by manufacturing products that go straight from the store to the landfill. Although not purchasing a product is quite effective at the individual scale, it takes considerable social movements to boycott companies and make any difference at the larger scale.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, reducing our demand will be crucial to lower our impacts. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that we have to stop purchasing products completely, as it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to stop buying smartphones, clothing, and more. That&#8217;s especially true for essential products that have significant environmental impacts, like food. </p>
            <p>To reduce our impacts when buying these types of products, we can simply aim for the most sustainable alternatives– since buying nothing isn&#8217;t always an option. And a good way to do that is by purchasing reusable products.</p>
            <h5 id="reuse"><strong>Reuse</strong></h5>
            <p>In an ideal world, we would only rely on reducing production and its impacts. However, in this one, we&#8217;ll need to reuse stuff that has already been produced and used, to avoid further production upstream. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that companies [through goodwill or government policies] can use the second R the best, since they have the reach to implement large scale reuse programs. They also have the resources to repair any of their slightly damaged products before putting them back on the market – and the authority to assure customers that the reused product is up to the company&#8217;s standards. </p>
            <p>For individuals, changing the stigma around buying used products will be important. If we&#8217;re not on board with the whole reuse concept, then there&#8217;s really no point in setting up large scale reuse programs. Luckily, numerous reuse systems have been growing in popularity in recent years [e.g. for clothing] and have shown that individuals are ready to buy used. </p>
            <p>There are essentially 2 ways for individuals to be part of reuse systems. One option is purchasing items that were designed for multiple uses. For example, a durable T-shirt that can be worn for many uses before breaking down. For the environment and your wallet, items like these are typically more expensive up-front, but are almost always cheaper in the long term.</p>
            <p>The second scenario is to reuse objects that weren&#8217;t necessarily designed for multiple uses. By reusing plastic bags we already own, or buying second-hand items like smartphones or clothing, we can effectively reduce production upstream and save a bit of cash. While it&#8217;s true that certain reused items can deteriorate and need repair from time to time, the environmental benefits resulting from their reuse almost always end up outweighing the drawbacks. Note that some exceptions exist for older products that are far more wasteful than newer ones, like very old cars, toilets, or lightbulbs.</p>
            <h5 id="recycle"><strong>Recycle</strong></h5>
            <p>We all know this one, right? Recycling is without a doubt the most integrated R in our societies. This might be because it&#8217;s the only R that doesn&#8217;t reduce the amount of stuff we buy. Reducing and reusing limits our purchases, and unsurprisingly companies aren&#8217;t big fans of that. On the other hand, recycling can increase profits for companies by avoiding&nbsp;more resource exploitation. </p>
            <p>Currently, public recycling remains unprofitable for many materials in many countries, but that can change with better waste management systems and policies.</p>
            <p>In any case, it is certain that recycling will have to play a pivotal role in transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones, since <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/5-recycling-myths-busted-plastic/#:~:text=Recycling%20steel%20and%20tin%20cans,those%20products%20from%20virgin%20materials.">recycled</a> products can be made using <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_New_Circular_Vision_for_Electronics.pdf">much less</a> energy than products made from scratch – all the while reducing waste. Additionally, as we&#8217;ve seen for metals, resource extraction creates significant local pollution and depletes finite resources – 2 things that can be avoided thanks to recycling. </p>
            <p>With that in mind, what if we could instead recycle all components, thus creating a self-sufficient loop until the end of time? A fantastic idea, but there are some inconvenient truths and a lot of progress to be made:</p>
            <ol type="1"><li>Recycling is a complicated process that involves lots of sorting. The trash separation we&#8217;re encouraged to do in our homes is only the first step of sorting. Since we can&#8217;t ensure that all individuals respect their local recycling guidelines, recycling plants require even more sorting to avoid contaminating different types of recyclables. In addition, there are loads of different types of metals, plastics, and even glass – all recycled differently and separated as to not contaminate each other. All these sorting requirements create a lot of nit-picky work, which is done by both recycling plant workers and energy-consuming machines.</li><li>Even if we were to get our triage perfect, we create many non-recyclable materials such as some metal alloys and plastics. Some of these materials can be recycled as a chunk of material [like a brick], but not while keeping all their interesting properties. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re not very good at transforming the shape or size of many of these man-made materials without altering their carefully engineered structure – or it&#8217;s far too costly to do so. We also have trouble restoring any damage caused to a material during use [e.g. batteries that &#8216;eat&#8217; themselves during use]. </li><li>Even if we were able to triage and recycle all materials, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to stop extracting resources completely. Our recycling efficiency is incredibly variable depending on the material. For example, we have a great recycling efficiency for lead – because we invested a lot in lead recycling after learning how toxic it is when dumped in the environment. Alas, most materials don&#8217;t have that high of a recycling efficiency [for now], as demonstrated by plastic waste – of which only <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/">9</a>% has ever been recycled [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/#:~:text=Of%20the%208.3%20billion%20metric,the%20natural%20environment%20as%20litter."><span style="text-decoration:underline;">EU and China have been getting better, not the US</span></a>].</li><li>A self-sufficient cycle has one fundamental law: production can&#8217;t exceed waste. Even if all the recycling problems stated above didn&#8217;t exist, we&#8217;re still in a world of increasing material demand. As our demography and quality of life standards continue to rise, our consumption continues to increase. This is another reason why recycling cannot replace the first 2 Rs, all 3 must be employed simultaneously. </li><li>Recycling guidelines vary drastically between different regions of the world. This makes it incredibly hard for individuals to figure out which recyclables are accepted by their local recycling plant, and which should be thrown out as &#8216;regular&#8217; trash. Online tools have been developed by certain regions to address this issue, but most individuals aren&#8217;t even aware that the tools exist.</li><li>We also can&#8217;t recycle everything indefinitely, as many materials will break down after a certain number of uses. The good news is that we&#8217;re evolving away from one-and-done recycling – as materials that could previously only be recycled once can now be recycled multiple times [e.g. plastics, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/5-recycling-myths-busted-plastic/#:~:text=Recycling%20steel%20and%20tin%20cans,those%20products%20from%20virgin%20materials."><span style="text-decoration:underline;">paper</span></a>, etc&#8230;].</li><li>Not everything is collected. Recycling for many products just isn&#8217;t possible or profitable. For example, it&#8217;s estimated that there are up to <a href="https://ed.ted.com/on/uGlYK7C5?theme_id=earth-school"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">70</span></a> chemical elements in an average smartphone, including hard-to-recycle metal alloys. It&#8217;s also estimated that phones and other electronics can contain up to <a href="https://ed.ted.com/on/uGlYK7C5?theme_id=earth-school"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">16 of the 17</span></a> types of rare earth metals. Although these metals are certainly valuable, they&#8217;re present in such small amounts that companies often deem them &#8216;unworthy&#8217; of collection.</li></ol>

            <p>We can&#8217;t reach a 100% circular economy. However, employing the 3 Rs simultaneously at all scales can help us get as close as possible. On top of reducing waste, this will help us avoid unnecessary resource extraction and energy consumption. </p>

            <p><strong>Reduce</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t buy stuff you don&#8217;t need.</strong> It&#8217;s the easiest way to reduce. Determine whether the purchase is essential.</li><li><strong>Purchase sustainable products.</strong> Since we still need to buy essentials, we&#8217;ll have to reduce our impacts by purchasing the most sustainable alternatives available [within your price range].</li><li><strong>Think ahead before going out. </strong>This can help avoid relying on last-minute items that are often single-use [e.g. bags, bottles, etc&#8230;].</li><li><strong>Avoid single-use products, except maybe toilet paper.</strong> Cloths vs. paper towels, reusable bottles vs. plastic bottles, and reusable face masks vs. disposable masks are only a few battles of the war on single-use products.</li><li><strong>Reduce your dependence on packaging.</strong> Small plastic coffee capsules aren&#8217;t the only examples of ridiculous packaging strategies.</li><li><strong>Reduce sources of waste. </strong>Without necessarily going through your trash, try to examine which products create the most waste in your life and try to find more sustainable alternatives.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Reuse</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Avoid hoarding what you don&#8217;t use.</strong> To extend a product&#8217;s lifetime and encourage reuse, sell or donate your old belongings.</li><li><strong>Purchase used products. </strong>That includes second-hand, but also third, fourth, and so on. As long as the product can serve a purpose. There are a few exceptions for old products that pollute/consume much more than new ones during use, like old cars, toilets, and lightbulbs.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Recycle</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Adopt a Bob the Builder mentality. </strong>Try to fix things or find someone that will. If it can&#8217;t be done, find a suitable recycling bin to properly dispose of the product. Throwing out a product should be last resort, especially considering all the effort made during the first 2 Rs to extend the product&#8217;s lifetime.</li><li><strong>Take advantage of good recycling systems.</strong> Not everyone is blessed with good recycling programs, so make sure to use them and try to make the recycling process easier [next point].</li><li><strong>Research general recycling tips online. </strong>If you can find your regional waste management&#8217;s website, even better [if not, find another region&#8217;s website near you]. They should have tips and factoids that will help you recycle more efficiently and increase the recycling plant&#8217;s efficiency too.</li><li><strong>Advocate for better recycling systems. </strong>If your region/building doesn&#8217;t have a good recycling system, let the people in charge know that you&#8217;d like to recycle.</li></ul>
            <h5 id="larger-scales"><strong>LARGER SCALES</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>Reduce</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Reduce by design.</strong> Producing reusable/recyclable packaging, durable products, and resource-efficient products are just a few of the many ways companies can lower their impacts while maintaining production.</li><li><strong>Businesses: Encourage low-impact mentalities by defining a new &#8216;norm&#8217;. </strong>Right now, individuals are expected to go out of their way to reduce their impacts. Companies can help turn that around by making sure that the default settings on their products are the same as the lowest impact settings [e.g. default double-sided printing]. This will ensure individuals don&#8217;t pollute due to laziness or lack of awareness of their impacts.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Impose a heavier tax on single-use products. </strong>This would require a quick study to determine which single-use products we can&#8217;t substitute to leave them out of the tax [e.g. toilet paper]. We also wouldn&#8217;t want to penalize individuals that live paycheck-to-paycheck.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Impose heavier taxes on non-essentials, lower taxes on food and other necessities. </strong>This would help reduce the number of useless purchases, without threatening hunger on less fortunate individuals.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Ban wasteful packaging. </strong>This can help avoid excessive packaging on products that don&#8217;t really need it. Most fruits and vegetables are good examples of products that simply don&#8217;t require individual plastic wrapping.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Reuse</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Extend product lifetimes.</strong> Businesses should encourage multiple uses of their products by purchasing their used products from their customers at a cheap price. Then, after a little refurbishing, the product can be sold back to the public. This would ensure reasonable quality standards are met while employing reuse cycles.</li><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Allow and facilitate the &#8216;right to repair&#8217;.</strong> Individuals and repair shops should be able to repair broken products. Refusing to provide the know-how to do so restricts our ability to reuse products and extend their lifetimes.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Recycle</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Retain responsibility for a product.</strong> Customers should be made aware whether the product can be recycled by regular recycling plants or if they should send it back to the seller. In short, it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s responsibility to ensure the product ends up reused or recycled in the best way possible.</li><li><strong style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"><em>Businesses &amp; Governments: </em>Employ/Enforce industrial symbiosis. </strong><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">If an industry wants a specific chemical, and that chemical is being thrown out by another industry, then why not try to close the loop? Governments can enforce industrial symbiosis by banning manufacturers from throwing out &#8216;valuable waste&#8217; [i.e. that can still be used].</span></li><li><strong><em>Businesses &amp; Governments:&nbsp;</em>Improve industrial waste management.&nbsp;</strong>The industrial sector has to be held responsible for the waste they let loose in the environment. Especially when they have options to reduce their production costs with good waste management, better reuse programs, and better recycling systems.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Increase the number of recycling plants and workers.</strong> These are easy investments that create loads of jobs. Increasing the number of sorting workers in each plant will immediately boost recycling efficiency.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Establish specialized recycling plants for each category.</strong> This can help maximize recycling efficiency for each material, which would increase material recovery. This would either require individuals to become much better sorters [thanks to more info on each product] or require sorting facilities to serve as middlemen.</li><li> <strong><em>Governments: </em>Stop judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree. </strong>Instead of looking at recycling facilities as potential money-makers, start treating them as the eco-friendly solutions they are. Recycling plants are meant to divert waste from landfills/incineration plants and allow material recovery – making profits should not be the first priority.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Incentivize recycling.</strong> Although recycling plants shouldn&#8217;t strive for profits, engaging individuals with small monetary rewards can be extremely beneficial for recycling systems [e.g. consigned beer cans]. Additionally, it will provide a little extra income to trash-pickers, who could definitely use the money. It would also reduce litter in urban areas. </li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Think ahead for materials that have inefficient recycling. </strong>Some materials just use too much energy to be worth recycling. On top of avoiding these materials in product design, keeping the waste aside might be a good idea if a specific material&#8217;s recycling progress experiences a breakthrough in the future.</li></ul>

            <p>HVAC systems are responsible for&nbsp;57% of residential energy consumption in most developed countries, on average. The average residential sector in the same developed countries accounts for&nbsp;20% of final energy use – so we have the means to reduce a big chunk of our energy consumption by changing our temperature control practices.</p>
            <p>Preventive temperature control is extremely important to reduce the need for reactive control. Improving insulation is one of the most important preventive temperature control measures, as it can significantly reduce HVAC energy consumption. In addition, realizing that we can live comfortably at a wide range of temperatures [e.g. 18-26°C] will help us reduce our HVAC needs. We just need to dress accordingly.</p>
            <p>When preventive control isn&#8217;t sufficient, we rely on HVAC systems. These devices allow us to quickly stabilize space temperatures, but they&#8217;re costly and energy intensive. To reduce our impacts, we&#8217;ll need to pass the right policies, use HVAC systems as little as possible, and replace old systems with more efficient ones once end of life is reached. </p>
            <p>Without any measures in place, the world will see a surge in energy consumption from such devices, especially in warmer climates where many countries are still developing. Global A/C energy demand is expected to triple by 2050.</p>
            <p>Improving preventive temperature control is paramount, as it will help reduce the need for reactive control. Decreasing HVAC energy consumption can help us lower our GHG emissions considerably, hopefully keeping us out of a climate-change-induced vicious circle.</p>

            <p>HVAC systems [Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning] are responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">57</a>% of residential energy consumption in select <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">IEA</a> developed countries, on average [excluding water heating – would add another <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">16</a>%]. Improving temperature control could easily slash household energy consumption significantly, resulting in lower emissions and lower costs. </p>
            <p>For reference, the average residential sector in the same IEA developed countries accounts for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">20</a>% of their final energy use – so we have the means to reduce a big chunk of our energy consumption. The environmental upside here is far too important to be ignored. We must adopt better solutions now and make them more affordable. </p>
            <p>Note that residential energy consumption denotes both the electricity and natural gas consumption in a home. Heating is usually sourced with natural gas, while cooling typically consumes electricity. The cleanliness of the local electricity mix can determine whether electricity emits less or more GHGs than natural gas per unit of energy consumed. </p>
            <p>There are essentially two categories of temperature control processes: preventive and reactive [we&#8217;ll see predictive/pre-emptive in the solutions]. </p>
            <h5 id="preventive-temperature-control"><strong>Preventive Temperature Control</strong></h5>
            <p>This refers to the ability of a house or building to withstand outside temperature changes. As external temperatures rise or drop for short periods of time, a house equipped with good preventive measures will see little to no variation in the internal temperature. This can significantly lower the need for reactive control.</p>
            <p>Improving a house&#8217;s insulation is extremely important, although we have to make sure we&#8217;re using sustainable insulation materials. We&#8217;ll see in the solutions that there are many other things we can do to improve our preventive temperature control as well.</p>
            <h5 id="reactive-temperature-control"><strong>Reactive Temperature Control</strong></h5>
            <p>This refers to the systems that can quickly modify space temperature, like HVAC systems, geothermal heat pumps, or solar thermal panels [the last 2 can be effective but are currently uncommon]. When a home has poor preventive control, its temperature will vary in sync with the external temperature, at which point an HVAC system usually turns on. Whether this is done automatically or with the press of a button, the problem stays the same: reactive temperature control is responsible for a massive share of our residential energy consumption. Consequently, better preventive temperature control is extremely important and is always the better investment long term.</p>
            <p>Apartment buildings, company headquarters, and houses that have multiple floors and rooms also share the need for good ventilation – otherwise different rooms would have different temperatures [although that can be an advantage if certain rooms need to be kept cool/warm]. </p>
            <p>Houses are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">large</a> heating and cooling energy consumers since they&#8217;re surrounded by a varying external temperature – so good preventive control is crucial for them. </p>
            <p>Apartment units are usually <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">much lower</a> energy consumers than houses due to smaller air spaces per capita and shared HVAC equipment, but are perfect examples of how wasteful HVAC systems can be when poor preventive control is in place. Imagine two neighbors separated by a thin, large wall. This wall has extremely low temperature insulation.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s imagine side A of the wall is kept at 18°C, while the other [side B] is maintained at 24°C. Due to crappy insulation, side A cools side B – and B heats A. How can these systems ever reach their stable final temperatures? They don&#8217;t [not for long at least], and meanwhile both the cooling from side A and the heating from side B of the apartment continuously draw considerable amounts of power [note that for houses, the other side of the wall would be outside – which partly explains why they&#8217;re such large HVAC energy consumers].</p>
            <h5 id="what-s-the-future-of-hvac-and-its-energy-consumption"><strong>What&#8217;s the Future of HVAC and Its Energy Consumption?</strong></h5>
            <p>In many developed countries, space heating energy consumption per area has <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">decreased</a> from 2000-2018. Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t mean space heating energy consumption has decreased, since there&#8217;s an increasing number of households. The major <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">reasons</a> for this decrease in energy intensity are better insulation systems, the migration of populations from hotter/colder climates to a more temperate climate year-round, the improved efficiency of HVAC systems, and a previously high baseline [i.e. space heating energy intensity was extremely high decades ago, so lowering it slightly isn&#8217;t much of an accomplishment].</p>
            <p>On the other hand, developing countries are facing a considerable increase in power consumption. Warm countries like Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and India each had under <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">17</a>% of their households equipped with A/C systems in 2018– but have a combined population size of over <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">2 billion</a> people. As these countries develop further, the percentage of households could rise toward that of developed countries like Japan [<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">91</a>% equipped]. That helps explains why A/C energy demand has <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/cooling">tripled</a> since 1990, and why it&#8217;s projected to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">triple</a> again by 2050. Similar effects with heating could take place in colder regions of the world, but that&#8217;s less of a concern since cold countries are typically more developed and already equipped with heating systems.</p>
            <p>Buying efficient HVAC systems is an easy way to decrease our HVAC power consumption. At an individual scale, the higher cost of efficient technologies would be offset in the following years with lower energy bills. Unfortunately, high-efficiency equipment won&#8217;t help us avoid the projected spike in A/C energy demand in developing countries – since there are just so many households to equip. Nonetheless, efficient technologies can help bring the 2050 projection of A/C energy demand down from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">3</a> times the current energy demand to only <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">1.7</a> times. </p>
            <p>Alas, it&#8217;s not always the right time to upgrade our HVAC systems. Slight efficiencies may not be worth replacing most of our current A/C units, as the life-cycle impacts from the new units need to be considered – especially at the individual scale. In that scenario, waiting for our old units to die before replacing them is likely the best thing to do.</p>
            <p>The only sustainable solution is to reduce our HVAC demand at all scales. For governments, that will mean passing policies that incentivize individuals to improve their preventive temperature control. The right policies could allow people of any income level improve their home&#8217;s insulation, for example.</p>
            <p>For individuals, that will mean changing the way we think about temperature, on top of improving preventive temperature control. Instead of just keeping temperatures at one setting year-round, we&#8217;ll need to cope with slight temperature variations in our homes [e.g. 18-26°C]. Otherwise, if we&#8217;re unable to adapt to slight weather variations, the world&#8217;s HVAC systems will continue to consume greater amounts of energy every year – which will increase our impacts on the environment. And that will worsen climate change, which will increase HVAC energy consumption during extreme climate events, and draw us into a vicious circle.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>If we take a step back to see the whole picture, this looks very similar to a single-use vs. reuse situation. We could extensively limit the need for reactive control with better preventive equipment and techniques. Not only would that help lower our energy bills, it would also help decrease residential energy demand considerably. In turn, that would lead to less resource extraction, less GHG emissions, and less biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p><strong>P.S. –Fireplaces</strong></p>
            <p>Burning wood isn&#8217;t a great alternative to fossil-fueled heating systems. We&#8217;ve already covered why in <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/renewables/">Renewables</a> when discussing energy production from biomass. </p>

            <ul><li><strong>Adapt to temperature fluctuations. </strong>Instead of setting a single temperature year-round, adapt your settings based on the season. During the summer, wearing minimal clothing helps. During winter, you can slap on a hoodie and sweatpants. Remember that it&#8217;s completely normal to be hot in the summer and cold in the winter – and that&#8217;s not necessarily a problem. Same goes for day/night fluctuations. </li><li><strong>Alternatively,  set a loose temperature range. </strong>For example, you could just keep your temperature between 16-27°C. That may sound extreme, so just evaluate what you&#8217;d like your temperature range to be. If you can handle it, you can always add more flexibility later. </li><li><strong>Improve your household&#8217;s insulation.</strong> That includes wall, window, and roof <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/insulation"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">insulation</span></a>. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the walls are already up. Additionally, make sure that the insulator material is made of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/insulation/insulation-materials"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">recycled</span></a>/recyclable materials in a low pollution process – unlike some types of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44738952"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">polyurethane</span></a> insulator foams. This will ensure your good intentions aren&#8217;t counterproductive.</li><li><strong>Have your household optimized by experts.</strong> From blower door tests to insulation assessments, there&#8217;s plenty you can do to pinpoint a few of your preventive temperature control inefficiencies.</li><li><strong>Play around with exterior colors.</strong> If you live in a particularly hot region, paint your house&#8217;s exterior in a light color to avoid absorbing the sunlight heat. For others who live in colder regions, opt for darker shades. This will help you use your house&#8217;s reflectiveness to your advantage.</li><li><strong>Remember that outside air has a different temperature and is free.</strong> To change your space temperature, check the weather and open/close a window if it makes sense to do so. This can help you avoid using HVAC systems when unnecessary. </li><li><strong>Use your blinds and curtains effectively.</strong> To strengthen preventive control, close your blinds and curtains to reduce the sunlight/exterior temperature&#8217;s effect on your household. To improve reactive control, you can always open them up in a flash.</li><li><strong>Use temperature-intensive appliances sparingly.</strong> Anything that requires heating or cooling of large volumes, like saunas and hot-tubs – are heavy energy consumers. </li><li><strong>Stop using your fireplace. </strong>Alternatively, pimp out your <a href="https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/learn-you-burn-wood-what-you-can-do"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">fireplace</span></a>.</li><li><strong>Replace your HVAC systems with more efficient ones. </strong> Try doing this only once the systems have reached the end of their lifecycles to avoid wasting any good years the current system has left.

Not very eco-friendly.</li><li><strong><em>Governments &amp; Businesses: </em>Make sure space heating and cooling aren&#8217;t counteracting each other.</strong> For example, it makes no sense to heat an arena when the ice rink needs to stay cool.</li><li><strong><em>Governments &amp; Businesses &amp; Apartment Buildings: </em>Adopt energy efficient technology and building automation systems.</strong> For larger scales, it makes sense to invest in the best available technologies to enhance energy efficiency, like geothermal heat pumps or solar thermal panels. Additionally, great strides with AI technology are being made every day to help reduce power consumption in large buildings. AI can help buildings adopt pre-emptive/predictive temperature control, which reduces waste energy consumption.</li><li><strong><em><strong><em>Governments &amp; Businesses &amp; Apartment Buildings:</em></strong> </em>Implement performance-based energy-efficiency projects. </strong>These types of investments are the closest thing to risk-free, yet many governments still consider them as indebting – so they don&#8217;t get a lot of attention. Better policies on performance-based contracts will help reduce energy consumption in public buildings considerably. It&#8217;s up to governments to decide how long that will take.</li><li><strong><em><strong><em>Governments &amp; Businesses &amp; Apartment Buildings:</em></strong> </em>Implement district heating and cooling systems for densely populated areas. </strong>District heating and cooling plants work very well in areas that have lots of buildings. On top of reducing inefficiencies with a centralized system, they can also help numerous buildings free themselves from the need for HVAC equipment.</li></ul>

            <p>Transportation accounted for&nbsp;28% of global final energy demand in 2017 and roughly 23% of&nbsp;global CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions&nbsp;in 2018. Since vehicles are extremely energy intensive and polluting, the transportation sector is an innovator’s dream.</p>
            <p>Passenger transportation is responsible for around 63% of total transportation energy use, while freight transport accounts for the remaining 37%. Globalization has allowed us to travel and trade goods over great distances, but our environment is once again paying the price. </p>
            <p>Aviation, shipping, and road vehicles have all increased their emissions in recent years, while rail continues to prove it&#8217;s the cleanest motorized transportation mode out there. Unfortunately, expensive train tickets are preventing people from reducing their footprint over long and short distances alike. To reduce environmental impacts, we&#8217;ll need to reevaluate whether eco-friendly public transit methods like buses, streetcars, or rail are really something we want to discourage with expensive fares. </p>
            <p>After taking the world by storm, electric vehicles&#8217; challenges are coming to light, slowly but surely. The pursuit for longer ranges with advances in battery efficiency will continue to titillate the research world, but that should be the least of our concerns. First, the EV industry relies on loads of finite resources, especially metals required for battery manufacturing. While it&#8217;s unsure whether we&#8217;ll be able to supply the EV industry with the amounts of metal it will require over the next decades, it is certain that doing so would have adverse effects – ranging from mining impacts to the finiteness of metals. Second, electrifying our transport is great, but we need to ensure it makes sense with our electricity mixes. An EV in a region dominated by coal for electricity production risks being counterproductive.</p>
            <p>Again, prioritizing public transit to reduce the number of cars on the road is the only surefire way to decrease environmental impacts in the long term. That requires much lower fares for long distance rail and city transit. And yes, electrifying public transit will be essential, but only because it makes sense to do so at that scale. Governments and companies can reduce the global transportation sector&#8217;s impacts considerably in the near future, if the right policies and solutions are adopted now.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence will also help reduce the number of cars in the world and on the road, although this type of technology is not without impacts on the environment either. With the proper systems in place, driverless vehicles will increase carpooling and make public transit an even better option. However, driverless vehicles aren&#8217;t available yet, with no guarantee of when they&#8217;ll roll out and help streamline public transit – so we&#8217;ll have to stick to proven solutions for now.</p>

            <p>Transportation accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/digitalisation-and-energy">28</a>% of global final energy demand in 2017. The sector released <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-transport-2020">8.2</a> Gt [1 Gt = 1 billion tonnes = 1 trillion kg] of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2018 alone, which represents roughly 23% of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> across all sectors the same year. Transportation&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have risen by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-transport-2020">41</a>% from 2000-2018. Alas, burning fuel doesn&#8217;t just emit CO<sub>2</sub> – it also releases toxic pollutants.</p>
            <p>Its high energy consumption and pollution make the transportation sector an innovator&#8217;s dream. Between artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, huge investments are being made to make this industry more sustainable. Both these advances have the potential to lower emissions, if applied globally at the proper scale. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have the time to wait around until they do. There are many policies and solutions that governments and companies can implement to reduce the sector&#8217;s global impacts effectively, instead of placing the blame solely on individuals. That being said, individuals have lots of opportunities to reduce their personal transportation impacts. </p>
            <p>Individual car needs are often linked to urban expansion and the proportional weakening of public transport services. In other words, as we move further away from the city, a car becomes increasingly necessary. It&#8217;s also true that as a city expands, more amenities get built far from the city center. Thus, urban populations also find themselves wanting cars. Both these factors [and many more] help explain why individuals were responsible for around <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/transportation.pdf">63</a>% of total transportation energy use in 2012.</p>
            <h5 id="globalization"><strong>Globalization</strong></h5>
            <p>We often overlook the transportation required for everything that surrounds us. Freight transport [vs. passenger transport] accounted for the remaining <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/transportation.pdf">37</a>% of the transportation sector&#8217;s energy use in 2012. Freight planes, boats, trains,&nbsp;and trucks supply us with food, raw materials, and anything else we buy far from home. For equal transportation methods, greater distances imply more fuel and therefore more emissions. However, we&#8217;ll see that some methods of transport are far more efficient than others, which we must take advantage of in the future.</p>
            <p>We should note that globalization has some wonderful aspects that allow us to share items worldwide and increase quality of life in many areas of the world. However, the environmental cost is already proving too much to bear. We need to reduce our impacts on the environment by shortening the distances we [i.e. individuals, food, other products] travel while choosing more efficient transportation methods.</p>

            <h5 id="planes"><strong>Planes</strong></h5>
            <p>Planes are astounding polluters due to the type of fuel used and the long distances travelled. Interestingly, countries don&#8217;t take responsibility for the pollutants that international airliners <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation#:~:text=CO2%20emissions%20from%20domestic,for%20countries%20to%20reduce%20them.">emit</a>. Instead, international flights are bundled together in a separate category that countries don&#8217;t really need to worry about – since emissions aren&#8217;t counted in their national totals.</p>
            <p>In 2018, international and domestic flights combined emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.93</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents roughly 11% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year. To put this in perspective – those emissions have the same weight as 9.3 billion giant pandas [with 1 panda = 100 kg] being released in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Aviation&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">38</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Planes use kerosene and other lightweight jet fuels [that have high energy density] to power the engines without adding too much weight to the aircraft. Unfortunately, these fuels release more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than standard fuel – but only <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php">7</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-03/documents/stationaryemissions_3_2016.pdf">8</a>% more. This doesn&#8217;t mean jet fuel isn&#8217;t as bad as everyone makes it sound, it means that we don&#8217;t realize how polluting gasoline is. One of the most interesting areas of innovation within the aviation sector is lowering GHG emissions by opting for alternative fuels.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s much easier said than done. We use the fuels we use because they have high enough energy densities [i.e. energy per unit of mass] to allow aircrafts to fly. And although hydrogen-fueled planes have received support from governments and aviation companies due to hydrogen&#8217;s extremely high energy density and apparent eco-friendliness, these types of planes currently face numerous challenges that make them an unlikely option in the near future.</p>
            <p>The graph below shows the amount of energy required by different passenger transportation modes – per passenger for an equal travelling distance. </p>

            <p>The only reason that planes aren&#8217;t that much worse than cars – as far as energy required per passenger-km, is that they can hold many people at once and are often full [that&#8217;s why private jets, for example, are such terrible polluters]. On the other hand, cars are often half-empty. Also, note that a single plane trip emits far more than a single car trip, but that&#8217;s really just due to the difference in distances travelled.</p>
            <h5 id="ships-and-boats"><strong>Ships and Boats</strong></h5>
            <p>Boats are pretty big polluters as well. In 2018, shipping emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.86</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents over 10% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 8.6 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Shipping&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were nearly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">38</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Additionally, oil spills can occur when ships crash or leak. That can be absolutely devastating to local populations and biodiversity. Media coverage has been present for a few of these oil spills in the past [while some went completely unnoticed] – so we know exactly how terrible these spills are for local health, food, and economy.</p>
            <p>As far as international freight transport goes, there&#8217;s no question that boats emit much less GHGs per unit weight of cargo than aircrafts. While both boats and planes end up emitting roughly the same amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> every year, we have to put that in perspective with the massive quantities of goods that ships transport. For example, maritime shipping accounted for roughly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/International_trade_in_goods_by_mode_of_transport#Trade_by_mode_of_transport_in_value_and_quantity">75</a>% of imported/exported goods [by weight] between the EU and the rest of the world in 2019. On the other hand, aircrafts were mostly used to transport higher-value products. </p>
            <p>If our goal is to reduce the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions as a whole – then we&#8217;re going to have to transition away from using airplanes for freight transport.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, boats still pollute since they burn fuel [often burning highly polluting residual fuel left after oil refining processes]. Large and heavy ones especially, so it&#8217;s not very surprising that cruise ships are being <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4277147/a-cruise-ship-s-emissions-are-the-same-as-1-million-cars-report-1.4277180">scrutinized</a> extensively for the damages they incur to the environment. After all, who would have thought that running a huge hotel solely on oil as an energy source could pollute so much?</p>
            <h5 id="trucks-and-cars"><strong>Trucks and Cars</strong></h5>
            <p>Trucks and cars emit way too many GHGs and toxic pollutants. In 2018, passenger and freight road vehicles emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">6.0</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents over 73% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 60 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Road transport&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were over <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">41</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Heavier vehicles like trucks consume more fuel and emit more GHGs per km than lightweight cars. However, there are other factors that can increase our individual emissions as well, like speed. Speeding on a highway burns more fuel than driving at the speed limit, even when considering the amount of fuel saved from the trip being completed early.</p>
            <p>Additionally, while gasoline may not be scrutinized as much as jet fuel, it remains a terrible polluter that nearly releases the same amount of GHGs per kg of fuel consumed. </p>
            <p>Road vehicles are astounding polluters because they are individualized. As such, the easiest thing to do to cut our transportation emissions in half is to carpool with one other person. Divide by three? Two people. This is why buses, although heavier, can emit much <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/PublicTransportationsRoleInRespondingToClimateChange2010.pdf">less</a> CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger-km. Improving shared services like public transit is by far one of the best ways to ensure cleaner mobility in cities and neighboring areas.</p>
            <h5 id="rail"><strong>Rail</strong></h5>
            <p>Trains have been one of the cleanest transportation modes for a while now, ever since most of them ditched coal many moons ago. In 2018, rail emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.08</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents just 1% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 0.8 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This is getting better, despite passenger rail usage <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">almost doubling</a> from 1996-2016. Rail&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">2.4</a>% lower than they were in 2000. That&#8217;s partly due to around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">75</a>% of passenger trains worldwide relying on electricity as a power source in 2016– a considerable increase from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">60</a>% in 2000.</p>
            <p>Trains are without a doubt the most eco-friendly way to travel long distances. Despite accounting for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">7</a>% of freight and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">8</a>% of passenger transportation worldwide, rail only accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">2</a>% of the transportation sector&#8217;s energy demand in 2016. </p>
            <p>Even for short distances, urban rail is proving <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/fb7dc9e4-d5ff-4a22-ac07-ef3ca73ac680/The_Future_of_Rail.pdf">very energy efficient</a>. However, for trains to really show how eco-friendly they are, we need people to use them. And that means reducing the cost of a ticket considerably. What message are we sending if the cost of low emission travel is terribly expensive? And for that matter, why are we even charging for public transit? Reducing individual transportation is one of the eco-friendliest solutions out there, but it simply can&#8217;t happen until public transit offers cheap fares for short and long distances alike. Government policies and subsidies for cleaner travel would be far more effective if concentrated on improving shared services, instead of other individualized solutions.</p>
            <h5 id="electric-vehicles"><strong>Electric Vehicles</strong></h5>
            <p>Electric vehicles [EVs] run on electricity stored chemically in batteries in the car &#8216;floor&#8217; [other types of EVs exist, but battery EVs are the most common]. These batteries are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9991">extremely</a> heavy for the amount of energy stored [low energy density], whereas gasoline has decent energy density. As a result, an EV weighs much more than a similarly sized combustion vehicle [CV].</p>
            <p>EV manufacturers are always looking to improve the range of their vehicles. We could just load the car with more batteries, but this would increase the car&#8217;s weight. And, if the mass of the vehicle increases, then so does power consumption. That&#8217;s part of the challenge of increasing EV range. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an easy solution, since loading up more batteries would increase both the energy supply and consumption of an EV.</p>
            <p>The solution for increasing the range isn&#8217;t in the number of batteries, it&#8217;s inside the batteries. Researchers worldwide are working on increasing the energy density and lifetime of batteries. In 2018-2019, the battery energy density in average electric vehicles was <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">20-100</a>% higher than it was in 2012, while battery costs have decreased by over <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">85</a>% since 2010. Governments and companies are also working on increasing the number of charging stations along popular travel routes to fight against range anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>2 Important EV Problems </strong></p>
            <p>While EVs are becoming <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">increasingly common</a>, they have their fair share of challenges. </p>
            <p>First, batteries require loads of components and metals. For example, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">19</a> kilotonnes of cobalt, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17</a> kt of lithium, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">22</a> kt of manganese, and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">65</a> kt of nickel were required to make batteries for EVs sold in 2019. If over a million pandas-worth of metals doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot, stay with us.</p>
            <p>As of 2019, the total worldwide supply of lithium was <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">77</a> kt per year across all industries, with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">21</a>% of that being used for EV production. By 2030, lithium demand for EVs alone is required to increase to at least <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">365.3</a> kt per year to align with the Sustainable Development Scenario – much higher than the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17</a> kt required in 2019. </p>
            <p>That&#8217;s just for lithium and EVs. We already know that renewables depend on this metal for energy storage, as do high-tech devices. And unfortunately, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">similar projections</a> exist for other metals that are critical to battery production – like cobalt, manganese, and nickel.</p>
            <p>Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that we won&#8217;t be able to meet this projected demand by 2030. However, we&#8217;re going to need to increase mining activity considerably – which will increase energy consumption and other mining impacts as well. </p>
            <p>Alas, it won&#8217;t stop there. There were &#8216;only&#8217; <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">7.2</a> million EVs on the road in 2019, compared to over 1 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/">billion</a> CVs. The massive increase in mining activity described above is only projected to help EVs reach <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-share-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">13.4</a>% of the total car share by 2030 – up from <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-share-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.8</a>% in 2019. If EVs are supposed to replace all CVs in the future, we can expect this increasing mining activity to continue for decades.</p>

            <p>The following graph shows how important and metal-intensive batteries will be in the upcoming green revolution. How we decide to adopt EVs [i.e. at an individual scale or for public transit] will have massive implications on mining activity and the speed at which we complete our energy transition. </p>

            <p>The second problem is really an electricity production problem. If our global electricity mix is still <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">37</a>% coal and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% Big 3, then recharging our EVs still has a considerable footprint [although that will depend on local electricity mixes]. </p>
            <p>Combining the metal supply and electricity mix problems, let&#8217;s see what we&#8217;ve got. Unsurprisingly, comparing a mid-sized EV [40 kWh battery pack] with a similarly sized CV [6.8 L/100 km] has shown that the EV emits <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">33-57</a>% more GHGs during manufacturing, which makes sense since the average EV is made with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">6 times</a> the mineral inputs required to make a CV.</p>
            <p><em>Helpful note for the following paragraph: the &#8216;CO<sub>2</sub>e&#8217; or &#8216;CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent&#8217; unit accounts for all GHGs and their greenhousiness, not just CO<sub>2</sub>.</em></p>
            <p>On the other hand, fuel impacts depend heavily on the electricity mix and the fuel consumption of the CV. For an electricity emission factor of 50 g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh, it&#8217;s estimated that EVs would emit <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">94.7</a>% less than CVs during fuel consumption [with an assumed lifetime of 200,000 km for both vehicles]. However, for an electricity emission factor of 800 g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/100 km, that lowers to just <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">15.3</a>% less than CVs during fuel consumption.</p>

All rights reserved.</span></a> </figcaption></figure></div>
            <p>Combining both production and fuel consumption, we can conclude that in the low-carbon electricity mix, EVs end up emitting <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">73.0-76.4</a>% less than CVs over a 200,000 km lifetime – or just <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">5.0-8.4</a>% less in a high-carbon electricity mix. Consequently, it&#8217;s incredibly important that individuals look up their local electricity emission factors to ensure that they&#8217;re not doing more harm than good – on top of the whole &#8216;metal-intensiveness&#8217; issue. For reference, the US national average grid electricity emission factor is around <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021-04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf">400</a> g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh in 2021 – while the EU had an emission factor of <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/co2-emission-intensity-6#tab-googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_chart_11111">275</a> g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh in 2019 [keep in mind that regional emission factors can be very different from local ones].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that lower fuel-consumption for CVs can also help slash the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions significantly. With more research and stronger regulations, we could design and offer affordable fuel-efficient vehicles [e.g. under 2 L/100 km] – which could help us reduce our impacts even further.</p>
            <p><strong>EV Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p>Although we&#8217;ve made great strides and are starting to see electric vehicles on the road more frequently, we should be careful of their collateral damage. It&#8217;s great that the public opinion is shifting in favor of decarbonizing the atmosphere. That should be our priority. However, like renewable energy technology – if we are too quick to adopt a &#8216;half-good&#8217; solution, we&#8217;ll end up creating more problems than we started with.</p>
            <p>The best solution is using our technology in moderation, where it makes sense to do so. EVs are helping and will continue to help lower the transportation sector&#8217;s GHG emissions. This will be even more evident as our global electricity mix further decarbonizes. However, we simply don&#8217;t have the resources for everybody to make the switch to EVs. Even if we did, digging up all the metals required would prove incredibly damaging to the environment and could slow down our energy transition.</p>
            <p>Our first priority shouldn&#8217;t be jumping the gun and banning new CV purchases by 2050, as many countries have ambitiously declared. Neither should it be to reject all EVs because they aren&#8217;t as clean as advertised. The most important thing we can do now is reduce our dependence on individual transportation while demanding improved-cheap public transit. At the same time, we can focus on electrifying public transit [e.g. with trams/streetcars, rail, EV buses, etc&#8230;], since public transportation is the future of eco-friendly travel.</p>
            <h5 id="artificial-intelligence"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h5>
            <p>Artificial intelligence [AI] has the potential to reduce the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions, especially for public transport. It could allow our cities to become well-oiled machines, where efficiency rules. This would reduce fuel waste, encourage the use of public transport, and redefine vehicle sharing apps.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re still years [or decades] of investments, research, and trials away from driverless vehicles becoming available to the public. Additionally, even if the technology were proven and integrated in our societies, a driverless vehicle wouldn&#8217;t magically stop consuming fuel. Although fuel consumption could be optimized with efficient AI software and car-to-car communication [e.g. to reduce traffic], that would barely make a dent in the sector&#8217;s total emissions. Without mentioning the hidden impacts that this type of AI technology can have [e.g. data storage]. As we&#8217;ve stated previously, a shift to public-transit-dominated societies is required.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, driverless vehicles could one day revolutionize public transit by driving people that don&#8217;t live near public transit routes to the nearest station. This could help us replace buses that run with little to no passengers with mini shuttles. These driverless shuttles would then operate at lower costs and lower fuel consumption – since they wouldn&#8217;t have drivers and would be much lighter than large buses. </p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles would also be pivotal for car-sharing applications when public transit isn&#8217;t an option, to reduce the number of cars in the world [by reducing the number of cars not in use]. While this wouldn&#8217;t necessarily reduce the number of cars in use at any given moment, AI algorithms could help with that by making carpooling and car-sharing much more convenient. </p>

            <p>Transportation accounted for&nbsp;28% of global final energy demand in 2017 and roughly 23% of&nbsp;global CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions&nbsp;in 2018. Since vehicles are extremely energy intensive and polluting, the transportation sector is an innovator’s dream.</p>
            <p>Passenger transportation is responsible for around 63% of total transportation energy use, while freight transport accounts for the remaining 37%. Globalization has allowed us to travel and trade goods over great distances, but our environment is once again paying the price. </p>
            <p>Aviation, shipping, and road vehicles have all increased their emissions in recent years, while rail continues to prove it&#8217;s the cleanest motorized transportation mode out there. Unfortunately, expensive train tickets are preventing people from reducing their footprint over long and short distances alike. To reduce environmental impacts, we&#8217;ll need to reevaluate whether eco-friendly public transit methods like buses, streetcars, or rail are really something we want to discourage with expensive fares. </p>
            <p>After taking the world by storm, electric vehicles&#8217; challenges are coming to light, slowly but surely. The pursuit for longer ranges with advances in battery efficiency will continue to titillate the research world, but that should be the least of our concerns. First, the EV industry relies on loads of finite resources, especially metals required for battery manufacturing. While it&#8217;s unsure whether we&#8217;ll be able to supply the EV industry with the amounts of metal it will require over the next decades, it is certain that doing so would have adverse effects – ranging from mining impacts to the finiteness of metals. Second, electrifying our transport is great, but we need to ensure it makes sense with our electricity mixes. An EV in a region dominated by coal for electricity production risks being counterproductive.</p>
            <p>Again, prioritizing public transit to reduce the number of cars on the road is the only surefire way to decrease environmental impacts in the long term. That requires much lower fares for long distance rail and city transit. And yes, electrifying public transit will be essential, but only because it makes sense to do so at that scale. Governments and companies can reduce the global transportation sector&#8217;s impacts considerably in the near future, if the right policies and solutions are adopted now.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence will also help reduce the number of cars in the world and on the road, although this type of technology is not without impacts on the environment either. With the proper systems in place, driverless vehicles will increase carpooling and make public transit an even better option. However, driverless vehicles aren&#8217;t available yet, with no guarantee of when they&#8217;ll roll out and help streamline public transit – so we&#8217;ll have to stick to proven solutions for now.</p>

            <p>In 2018, food systems accounted for roughly&nbsp;33% of our global GHG emissions [note that many reports have more cautious estimates, like the IPCC’s&nbsp;21-37% range]. Unsurprisingly, the farming stage – where crops or animals are grown – is responsible for the majority of our food system&#8217;s emissions. </p>
            <p>On top of these emissions, farmlands [i.e. croplands and pastures] cover around half of the Earth&#8217;s habitable surface. With our current food system, that fraction is projected to rise to satisfy the demands of an increasing and increasingly wealthy population. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a shortage of arable land in the world, and deforestation for agriculture is not a very good alternative. We&#8217;re going to have to rely on trees and their biodiversity to sequester carbon in the future, so destroying our long-term ally for an immediate result doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense. That is, if there&#8217;s a way to change our current unsustainable food systems.</p>
            <p>Animal-free diets are much better for the environment, in every single way. Between livestock consuming roughly a third of all grown crops, releasing massive amounts of GHGs, and causing roughly 67% of deforestation for agriculture, we have loads of reasons to adapt to different diets. </p>
            <p>Basing our food systems around livestock production just doesn&#8217;t make sense. To feed the animals, we revert to land use conversion and/or provide livestock with nutritious plant-based meals, only to recover a fraction of the calories and protein input later.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of policies and subsidies that governments can implement or remove to increase food security sustainably. However, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that unsustainable diets will have to change. It&#8217;s also important to note that it&#8217;s much harder for producers to adopt more sustainable practices than it is for consumers to refine their diet. Producers are located in distinct parts of the world and operate at very different scales, so one farmer&#8217;s sustainable actions may not be suitable for the rest.</p>
            <p>Plant-based diets can help the food industry reduce its land use by several million km<sup>2</sup> by 2050, which would help us restore green ecosystems worldwide. They could also help lower the food system&#8217;s GHG emissions by up to 8.0 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year by 2050. Developed countries and heavy meat eaters have the opportunity to cut down on their emissions the most, although it will take time. This transition can be facilitated by governments and food companies by effectively communicating food products&#8217; impacts to customers. And as always, buying local, in season, and not wasting are surefire ways to decrease your footprint.</p>
            <p>Food wastage reflects that it&#8217;s not just diets that need to change, it&#8217;s the whole food system. We can&#8217;t keep wasting a third of food produced for humans if our goal is to increase food security – while not destroying precious ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Food is an extremely polarizing topic due to its importance in our everyday lives and its massive impacts on the environment. In 2018, food systems released about <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">16</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e in the atmosphere [160 billion pandas] – equivalent to roughly <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">33</a>% of our global GHG emissions the same year [note that many reports have more cautious estimates, like the IPCC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/">21-37</a>% range].</p>
            <p>Including the effects of land use conversion like deforestation, the farming stage [i.e. excluding food transport, supply chains, or waste disposal] accounted for <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">65</a>% of food&#8217;s GHG emissions in 2018.

Our food systems also caused <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">32</a>% of terrestrial acidification and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">78</a>% of eutrophication in 2018, which can both destroy ecosystems and induce biodiversity loss. </p>
            <p>Many factors can increase a food product&#8217;s footprint, such as cooking methods, transportation, and packaging – but it&#8217;s clear that the farming stage has the highest impacts of them all. So that&#8217;ll be the main focus of this section. </p>
            <p>Personal diets aside, it&#8217;s important to understand that our food systems are causing environmental crises in some of the most biodiverse parts of the world. Simply put, we need the current food system to change to become more eco-friendly. Not only to reduce our present impacts, but also to ensure a secure food access to an increasing – and increasingly demanding population.  </p>
            <h5 id="land-and-population"><strong>Land and Population </strong></h5>
            <p>In 2019, around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">51</a> million km<sup>2</sup> of land were used for agriculture [includes pastures for animals and fields for crops]. That represents around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">50</a>% of the Earth&#8217;s habitable land area. Unfortunately, it won&#8217;t stop there if we don&#8217;t change our food systems – since we&#8217;ll soon need more food for our growing population. In fact, worldwide food production is expected to grow by roughly <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i6583e/i6583e.pdf">48</a>% from 2013-2050. </p>
            <p>On top of population growth, many densely populated countries are still developing, and their populations are getting richer. Many who were constrained to eat smaller rations of local products can now eat larger meals like developed countries – with ingredients imported from all over the world. For example, China&#8217;s middle class – which has grown from roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/875874/middle-class-population-in-china/#:~:text=Number%20of%20middle%20class%20population%20in%20China%202002%2D2020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20number,approximately%20700%20million%20by%202020.">80</a> million in 2002 to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/875874/middle-class-population-in-china/#:~:text=Number%20of%20middle%20class%20population%20in%20China%202002%2D2020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20number,approximately%20700%20million%20by%202020.">700</a> million in 2020 – has increased the country&#8217;s average meat intake significantly in the past <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47057341">60</a> years [the graph below also shows the strong relationship between income and meat consumption]. Same goes for Brazil, another densely populated nation.</p>

            <p>To recap, food demand is increasing because of population growth, but also since the demand per capita is increasing in densely populated areas. </p>
            <p>Now to ensure food security, we need to produce more food. To produce more food, we need more crops. And for that, we need more arable land [we&#8217;ll see in a later section that changing our agricultural practices can also lead to more food production].</p>
            <p>The ever-increasing demand for arable land is a big problem since we don&#8217;t really discover new land every day. Our current solution seems to be burning/cutting down forests and other green ecosystems to allow crops to grow instead &#8211; which is proving very costly for the environment. We simply can&#8217;t afford to damage our vegetation – as it absorbs roughly a <a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">quarter</a> of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every year. That helps mitigate climate change, while land use conversion [e.g. deforestation] accelerates it. Vegetation also holds an incredible amount of biodiversity, so cutting down these forests results in biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s not all about land either. Aquatic ecosystems are being severely polluted because of our unsustainable food practices [e.g. chemical runoff causing eutrophication]. Fishing and aquaculture farms are threatening many marine ecosystems as well, mainly through careless fishing techniques and over-fishing [fun fact: some predatory farmed fish species can require loads of wild fishing to feed them].</p>
            <p>Instead of resorting to land use conversion, pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modifying our crops to increase food production temporarily, let&#8217;s see how easy it is to improve our food systems from the consumer side of things.</p>
            <h5 id="food-emissions-and-land-use"><strong>Food Emissions and Land Use</strong></h5>
            <p>No matter our diet, it&#8217;s important to understand how much our food pollutes before we eat it. The following graph shows the extent to which different products release GHG emissions during their life-cycle. Quickly zooming in on the next graph and finding the ingredients we eat the most can help us acknowledge how our everyday meals impact the environment.</p>

            <p>Clearly, animal products are the highest-impact foods. However, there are a few other products that emit loads of emissions as well – like coffee, chocolate, and oils.</p>
            <p>Whether we eat meat or not, we all consume some of the foods shown in the graph. And we&#8217;re not the only ones. Cattle [i.e. cows and bulls] don&#8217;t only eat grass like they do in cartoons, just like pigs don&#8217;t eat mud.</p>
            <p>While ruminants [e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, etc&#8230;] do consume roughly <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">2.7</a> billion tonnes of grass per year and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">65</a>% of this grass grows on unfarmable lands – that still leaves 35% of grazed land where lower impact foods could be grown instead. And more importantly, neither of those percentages account for the massive proportion of our crops that are grown in other parts of the world to end up as livestock [i.e. all farm animals] feed. It&#8217;s estimated that around a <a href="https://drawdown.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/DrawdownPrimer_FoodAgLandUse_Dec2020_01c.pdf">third</a> of all crops are grown to feed livestock, using <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/05/30/360.6392.987.DC1/aaq0216-Poore-SM-revision1.pdf">38</a>% of our arable and permanent croplands worldwide. </p>
            <p>Regardless of whether livestock eat grass or feed, it&#8217;s simply undeniable that they take up a lot of room. And with the significant increase in animal product consumption in recent decades, that has only led to agricultural expansion.</p>

            <h5 id="agricultural-expansion"><strong>Agricultural Expansion</strong></h5>
            <p>We&#8217;ve stated earlier that farmlands [i.e. land for crop and livestock farming] cover around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">50</a>% of the Earth&#8217;s habitable surface. Since the Earth is fully booked, increasing that percentage ever so slightly has usually led to deforestation and land use conversion of other green ecosystems. In fact, it’s estimated that agriculture was responsible for around&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/online/ca8642en.html#chapter-5_1">73</a>% of tropical deforestation worldwide from 2000-2010 [with tropical deforestation accounting for roughly&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation">95</a>% of total deforestation]. That&#8217;s a pretty big problem considering vegetation sequestrates loads of carbon in biomass and soils – while land use conversion releases that carbon back into the atmosphere. This helps explain why land use conversion is one of agriculture&#8217;s highest GHG-emitting activities. </p>
            <p>On the surface, it might seem like croplands are responsible for most of the deforestation occurring within the food industry, instead of livestock. If we dig deeper though, we find that animal products have the largest impacts once again. That&#8217;s because roughly <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">67</a>% of deforestation for agriculture aims to grow livestock feed. <em>Deforestation for agriculture is the process of clearing trees to use the land for agriculture. This type of land use conversion has significant impacts on the environment, such as biodiversity loss and releasing the carbon stored in the soil or biomass.</em></p>
            <p>The industry is well aware of the lack of space. We simply don&#8217;t have room to grow food for so many animals.</p>

            <p>Aside from deforestation, the industry&#8217;s current solution seems to be reducing each animal&#8217;s living space so that they&#8217;re only able to move a few inches in a certain direction. Not only is this an inhumane solution, it&#8217;s also unsustainable. Instead of dealing with the consequences of the problem, we should try and modify the root cause – only then will we come up with food systems that we can sustain for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <h5 id="food-s-inefficiencies-and-the-food-chain"><strong>Food&#8217;s Inefficiencies and the Food Chain</strong></h5>
            <p>CyclopediApp is devoted to pointing out inefficiencies in our current energy and resource consumption systems. Eating meat is one of those inefficiencies. Per unit weight or protein content, it&#8217;s easy to see that livestock consume <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production">more</a> food than they give back. While that would be acceptable if they were only eating inedible food scraps [i.e. feed requires no additional land or resources], we know that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

            <p>These inefficiencies make sense because that&#8217;s how the food chain works. When we eat food, our bodies consume the calories, protein, and other nutrients needed to make sure we remain alive and [ideally] healthy. However, unless we&#8217;re building muscle, those &#8216;food elements&#8217; aren&#8217;t really stored anywhere. So if anyone tried to eat us, they wouldn&#8217;t get all the food elements we got when we ate our food. In other words, we tax a certain amount of energy and nutrients from our food that can&#8217;t be retrieved if we ever get eaten. This is particularly true once we&#8217;ve stopped building muscle – although we still impose taxes on food elements when growing and building muscle [taxes are just a little lower].</p>
            <p>The same is true for the animals/plants we eat. When eating a food, we only consume a part of the food elements that this food has received from its food [and so on]. So if we ate a cow for example, then we&#8217;d only be getting a small part of the food elements that it got from grass or feed. In other words, cows are imposing a pretty hefty tax on us. To avoid this tax [i.e. to avoid inefficiencies in our food systems], we&#8217;d have to get lower on the food chain. This is the one of the main reasons why eating our &#8216;food&#8217;s food&#8217; can help us reduce our impacts on the environment. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than just the food chain. There are additional emission sources for different animals and farming practices – varying from enteric fermentation [with ruminant digestion], to aquaculture, and even manure. On top of just being fed, livestock have many other needs – including frequent antibiotic and growth promoting supplements [i.e. medicine and steroids]. The graph below shows that cattle GHG emissions are primarily released by enteric fermentation [in low emission farms], which indicates that the most efficient way to reduce cattle emissions is to reduce their population sizes.</p>

            <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb4474en">720-811</a>&nbsp;million humans having suffered from hunger in 2020, it&#8217;s tough to see livestock get a priority on food and medicine.</p>
            <h5 id="reducing-food-s-impacts"><strong>Reducing Food&#8217;s Impacts</strong></h5>
            <p>There are plenty of policies and subsidies that governments can implement or remove to increase food security sustainably. As always, these types of large-scale solutions are the most effective ones. However, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that unsustainable diets will have to change if we plan on reducing our impacts on the environment – no matter how successful the large-scale solutions are. </p>
            <p>Transitioning toward animal-free diets could help the food industry reduce its land use by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/210714-IPCCJ7230-SRCCL-Complete-BOOK-HRES.pdf">several million km<sup>2</sup></a> by 2050, which would help us restore green ecosystems worldwide. Additionally, phasing out animal products could help us lower the food system&#8217;s GHG emissions by up to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/210714-IPCCJ7230-SRCCL-Complete-BOOK-HRES.pdf">8.0</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year by 2050.</p>
            <p>Evidently, heavier meat eaters can make the greatest changes in their diets – so developed countries have the highest potential for GHG emissions reduction. For reference, meat consumption per capita in the US is over <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f/download_file?file_format=pdf&amp;safe_filename=Reducing_foods_environment_impacts_Science%2B360%2B6392%2B987%2B-%2BAccepted%2BManuscript.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Journal+article">3</a> times the global average.</p>
            <p>However, it&#8217;s important to remain realistic. While there&#8217;s certainly an urgency to adopt more sustainable diets, not everyone can change their habits overnight – which is okay. We just can&#8217;t take too long, since we need to start reducing our impacts now, not in a few years. </p>
            <p>Apart from self-banning categories of foods, it&#8217;s quite hard for consumers to do more. At that point, we&#8217;d need more information when selecting which foods to buy at the grocery store. For that to happen, governments and companies will have to collaborate to make sure that impacts for all food products are fairly evaluated and properly communicated to consumers. A simple example would be a little sticker on food products that indicates the amount of GHG emissions released during the entire production process. Alone, these types of numbers won&#8217;t help much – but official standards and certifications have the potential to help consumers compare similar products and guide more sustainable purchases [e.g. &#8216;fair-trade&#8217; certification].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s much harder for producers to adopt more sustainable practices than it is for consumers to refine their diet. Since the world&#8217;s <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">570</a>+ million farms employ different methods, are located in different environments, and have different sizes – there aren&#8217;t many solutions that can help increase sustainability across the board. In other words, what reduces impacts for a small farmer in Ukraine may do the opposite for large farming corporations in Brazil. Nonetheless, improving farming practices for the largest farming companies can drastically reduce the food sector&#8217;s emissions.</p>
            <h5 id="wastage"><strong>Wastage</strong></h5>
            <p>Wastage, which comprises both food waste and food loss – has devastating impacts on the environment. Here are a few concerning factoids, as of 2013:</p>
            <ul><li><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.3</span></a> billion tonnes of edible food are wasted or lost every year [13 billion pandas].</li><li>A <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">third</span></a> of all food produced for humans results in food wastage.</li><li><a style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);" href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">250</span></a><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"> km</span><sup style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">3</sup><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"> of freshwater are used to produce food that is either lost or wasted each year.

            <p>It&#8217;s extremely disappointing to see so many resources exploited to grow crops, only to see it all go to waste at some point during the production process, or later by consumers. Keep in mind the values listed were released in 2013, so they have surely changed a bit since. More recently, a 2021 UN report estimated that <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-17-all-food-available-consumer-levels-wasted">931</a> million tonnes – or <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-17-all-food-available-consumer-levels-wasted">17</a>% – of all food available at consumer levels is wasted every year, mostly by individuals. That&#8217;s 9.31 billion pandas-worth of food per year, which is over 1 panda per human every year.</p>
            <p>This wastage isn&#8217;t really surprising given that our food systems operate with the same careless methods that other industries are governed by [e.g. fast fashion]. Essentially, supermarkets would rather waste than be out of stock for a few days, so they buy too much – and consumers do the same. Luckily, even if we don&#8217;t change our over-consumerism methods soon, food wastage can still be minimized by donating food on the brink of spoilage to those in need [as some governments have enforced]. </p>
            <p>Local products are far less likely to spoil if purchased and require less transportation than imported foods. As such, wastage can be avoided with better food chain systems that avoid long transportation routes for highly perishable items [e.g. produce, meat]. </p>
            <p>The graph below shows one way to deal with food wastage.</p>

            <h5 id="food-security"><strong>Food Security</strong></h5>
            <p>While we could think that reducing food wastage means reducing food production and thus food security – that&#8217;s not the case. Many regions of the world already <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/agriculture/">suffer</a> from food insecurity and hunger, although global wastage rates are high – so we could simply reduce food wastage by sharing food with the hungry. This would effectively increase global food security, while maintaining current global production if need be. </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, we should note that completely eliminating global food wastage is neither a realistic nor desirable goal, since it would weaken global food security considerably.</p>
            <p>We should also note that increasing meat consumption in impoverished areas can have positive effects on local food security – which could be worth the high-impacts [e.g. with cattle fed from grass on local unfarmable lands]. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this is not the case in developed countries where high meat consumption is clearly unsustainable and continues to strain the world&#8217;s remaining natural resources.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Governments and companies have a lot of work to do to improve food systems swiftly at the largest scales and should be focused on better policies/farming practices – instead of placing the blame on consumers. However, it has to be clear that we can&#8217;t go on with our unsustainable diets. There&#8217;s simply no way we can keep them up for long – without mentioning the damage they incur to the environment. </p>

            <ul><li><strong>Reduce meat consumption.</strong> Adopt a plant-based diet. Alternatively, try a vegetarian diet. If you can&#8217;t swear off meat yet, go flexitarian – a fancy word to say you avoid meat as much as you can. If you can&#8217;t reduce your meat consumption yet, try to aim for the lowest impact meats [i.e. avoid ruminants].</li><li><strong>Forget about the labels.</strong> It&#8217;s easy to get stuck between 2 labels, because your diet doesn&#8217;t really match one of the diets mentioned above. If you need to eat meat once in a while, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t go vegan for the rest of your meals. It doesn&#8217;t make you a phony either. There are 0 constraints when changing your diet to reduce your footprint.</li><li><strong>Try new things.</strong> When changing your diet, the most important step is trying out alternatives. Especially when meat and dairy alternatives are improving every day. Individuals eating 3 meals a day end up eating close to 1,100 meals a year – so it shouldn&#8217;t hurt to try out a few weird-looking plant-based recipes once in a while. If you&#8217;re a fan of specific meat-based recipes, try subbing in another ingredient. If you don&#8217;t like it, that&#8217;s just 1/1,100 meals – keep trying. </li><li><strong>Find your high-impact foods.</strong> Try determining which of the foods you consume are considered high-impact, and see if you can find any better alternatives. </li><li><strong>Buy local and sustainable ingredients directly from the farm [i.e. at a farmer&#8217;s market].</strong> We should note that buying local doesn&#8217;t really help you lower your footprint that much. Instead, it&#8217;s more about encouraging small-scale farming, promoting sustainable producers, reducing food wastage from transport and supermarkets, and boosting your local economy.</li><li><strong>Grow a garden.</strong> Cultivating your own veggies inside or outside is a surefire way to reduce your footprint. Try growing local foods so that no extra irrigation is needed. Small gardens are low maintenance but a very big flex. </li><li><strong>Buy in season.</strong> Keeping up with which veggies grow during which months might seem annoying at first, but remember that this won&#8217;t change too much as time goes on. In other words, getting familiar with vegetable seasons is a life skill. </li><li><strong>Stick to water.</strong> Juices and coffee, among other beverages, are pretty big water consumers when you consider the irrigation needed to harvest the crops. Funny enough, a glass of orange juice needs much more water than a glass of water. Worldwide coffee production also releases a significant amount of GHGs in the atmosphere every year.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t waste food or drinking water.</strong> Stay in control of your fridge to make sure ingredients will be used before going bad. If you made excess food, keep it as leftovers. If you have too many leftovers, consider freezing some for later. Donate foods from your shelves that you know you&#8217;ll never eat. Use all the parts of an ingredient [e.g. stems, peels, etc&#8230;].</li><li><strong>Become a responsible consumer. </strong>Buy close-to-expiring foods at the supermarket if you know you&#8217;ll be using the ingredient soon. Also, buy the ugly looking product instead of the perfectly shaped one. These 2 actions will help grocery stores avoid food waste.</li><li><strong>Adopt a &#8216;bulk mentality&#8217;, within reason.</strong> Buying in bulk can reduce packaging and save money, as long as none of it ends up wasted.</li><li><strong>Learn how to properly shotgun a beer.</strong> Some of the videos online are just pathetic. As a helpful hint, if you end up drenched – you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong.</li><li><strong style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">Stop cooking with fossil fuels, if possible. </strong><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">Switch to electrically powered devices if your local electricity mix is cleaner than natural gas [check your electricity emission factor to confirm].

For example, palm oil has been a driver of tropical deforestation for decades. However, it&#8217;s <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/palm-oil"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">such a productive crop</span></a> that replacing palm oil with another type of oil could end up having a greater impact. This is especially true since many palm oil producers have now moved on to more sustainable practices. In any case, looking for sustainability certifications for products that contain these types of ingredients is definitely a good call – since it remains important to avoid products that have not switched to more sustainable practices.</li></ul>

            <p>Household appliances are often sneaky energy consumers, far less scrutinized than HVAC systems. It&#8217;s important to understand that anything that heats, cools, lights up, or moves needs energy. For the residential sector, most of that energy is supplied in the form of electricity or natural gas. </p>
            <p>Electronics are important electricity consumers, but luckily there are easy ways to reduce energy waste from these types of devices. Notably, by reducing standby power with better policies for large scales, or by unplugging electronic devices for individuals. </p>
            <p>Then, there are numerous energy-consuming appliances that have made their way into almost every household in developed countries, for no good reason. Dryers are the prime example, as they continue to increase household energy consumption by replacing sustainable drying methods that really don&#8217;t need replacing. </p>
            <p>Lighting is responsible for 15% of electricity consumption and 5% of GHG emissions worldwide. Replacing current light bulbs with LED bulbs is an extremely easy way to reduce one&#8217;s footprint and electricity bill. Better policies could ensure that inefficient bulbs are swiftly replaced by LEDs.</p>
            <p>Water heaters are tricky. Although reducing the set temperature is an excellent way to reduce emissions, low temperatures can also bring on legionnaire&#8217;s bacteria. It&#8217;s important to follow the recommended settings to lower consumption safely. Doing so will help us reduce water heating&#8217;s energy requirements, which currently stand at around 16% of residential energy consumption in select IEA countries. That large percentage makes sense, because everything that uses hot water in a home or building piggy backs on the water heater.</p>
            <p>Governments can pass numerous policies that would effectively reduce our appliances&#8217; impacts. Companies can also contribute by producing better quality items that use less energy and last longer. As for individuals, we can reduce our consumption by using household appliances sparingly and effectively in our day-to-day lives. And most importantly, before purchasing any household appliance, we should always ask ourselves if we really need it.</p>

            <p>If we&#8217;re going to discuss how we can improve energy efficiency and reduce material consumption in our everyday lives, we better mention household appliances. In 2019, household appliances were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/appliances-and-equipment">15</a>% of final electricity demand worldwide.</p>
            <p>Most appliances are powered by electricity or natural gas, like fridges, stoves, and most barbeque grills. Along with HVAC systems, this explains why the residential sector&#8217;s energy consumption is dominated by natural gas and electricity use [residential excludes transportation].</p>
            <h5 id="residential-energy-consumption"><strong>Residential Energy Consumption</strong></h5>
            <p>In general, everything that can heat, cool, light, or move needs energy. Our homes receive that energy as gas or electricity from local grids. While burning natural gas certainly emits CO<sub>2</sub>, we shouldn&#8217;t forget that electricity isn&#8217;t always better. As we&#8217;ve seen in an earlier section, around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% of global electricity production in 2019 came from burning the Big 3 fossil fuels. </p>
            <p>Appliances like showers or faucets also require energy in the form of water pressure. Pressurization occurs in underground water pipes by pumps that consume <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/understanding-your-water-bill">energy</a> – but there&#8217;s not much individuals can do about that except reduce water consumption and check for leaks. There are similar &#8216;hidden&#8217; energy requirements for compressors, which are essentially just pumps for natural gas. </p>
            <p>Although most of us only pay energy bills once a month, we should always remember that our residential energy/water consumption emits GHGs and toxic emissions into our atmosphere – even before reaching our home.</p>
            <p><strong>A Bit More Context</strong></p>
            <p>Residential and commercial/public sectors, which rely on many household appliances, were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-electricity-final-consumption-by-sector-1974-2018">48</a>% of worldwide electricity consumption in 2019. While that&#8217;s definitely significant, we should note that electricity consumption only accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">37</a>% of residential energy consumption in OECD countries [i.e. developed countries] in 2018– which shows that lots of energy is consumed outside of grid-distributed electricity, even in developed countries.</p>
            <p>By reducing our individual energy consumption in our households, we can help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The cool part is that we can do it all while chilling in our pajamas. </p>
            <p>We&#8217;ve already talked about how our HVAC systems take up over <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/temperature-control/">half</a> of residential energy consumption [on average in IEA developed countries], so we won&#8217;t revisit this. Instead, in this section we&#8217;ll focus on the non-HVAC half of our electricity and natural gas bills.</p>
            <h5 id="electronic-devices"><strong>Electronic Devices</strong></h5>
            <p>Pretty much anything plugged into a socket consumes electricity. For most devices, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if it&#8217;s turned on or not [but obviously they draw more power when &#8220;on&#8221;]. When appliances and devices like TVs, microwaves, or chargers are off, it turns out they still <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> &#8216;standby&#8217; power from the socket. </p>
            <p>In 1998, <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">0.6</a>% of total OECD CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were caused by standby power from the residential sector of those countries. That&#8217;s roughly the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions coming from <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">24</a> million European-type cars the same year. </p>
            <p>Efforts have been made since to regulate standby power, with moderate success. For the last 20 years, governments around the world have implemented regulations to limit the standby power at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/Guidance%20document_Lot%2026_Networked%20Standby_clean%20FIN.pdf">0.5-1</a> W [Watt] per appliance. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not being respected by many manufacturers, as their products continue to <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> much more standby power than admissible.</p>
            <p>1 Watt isn&#8217;t a lot of power. The average US home consumes electricity at an <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3">average</a> rate of 1,215 W. Still, with all our household appliances combined – and accounting for the many appliances that don&#8217;t follow the 1 Watt-initiative – standby power can easily add up to <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/795944">1-10</a>% of our electricity bills. It can be even worse in commercial buildings that are flooded with electronic devices. </p>
            <p>Governments have to double down on limiting standby power. It&#8217;s not enough to simply have a policy in place if it isn&#8217;t respected by most electronic devices. As for individuals, one easy solution is just unplugging our appliances when we&#8217;re not using them. These types of individualized solutions aren&#8217;t very effective at bringing about meaningful change, but they can still help us reduce our personal impacts.</p>
            <p><strong>Dryers</strong></p>
            <p>There are also appliances like dryers that have somehow made their way into the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/ENERGY_STAR_Scoping_Report_Residential_Clothes_Dryers.pdf">vast majority</a> of households in some developed countries [e.g. US]. In these areas, dryers are marketed as the washing machine&#8217;s counterpart, making it seem like owning one wouldn&#8217;t make sense without the other. That&#8217;s simply untrue. Drying clothes on racks or on ropes has been done for ages, and 9/10 dentists say it works fine. On average, it takes 1-24 hours to dry clothes without a dryer, some of that depending on whether the clothes are dried inside or outside, and the type of material/thickness of the garment.</p>
            <p>We understand the need to live life on the edge, and waiting until we&#8217;re out of undies to do laundry is exhilarating [also good for the environment, laundry every 2 days is not a great plan]. However, doing laundry just before our last pair would help avoid using a dryer and will lower our electricity consumption. Lots of clothes aren&#8217;t even suited to go in the dryer anyway [women clothes seem especially shrinky], so everyone should already know how to air-dry clothes.&nbsp;If not, it&#8217;s a pretty straightforward process. </p>
            <h5 id="lighting"><strong>Lighting</strong></h5>
            <p>Like electronic devices, lighting is also included in our electricity bill. Globally, it&#8217;s estimated that lighting accounts for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">15</a>% of electricity consumption and <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/led">5</a>% of GHG emissions [note that lighting isn&#8217;t always considered an appliance]. Power consumption for lighting is extremely easy to reduce when you have access to electricity [i.e. when you don&#8217;t have to burn fossil fuels]. We&#8217;ll go over 2 easy ways to optimize your lighting efficiency and reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>First, we can replace our lightbulbs with LED bulbs. These types of bulbs are way more <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/how-energy-efficient-light">efficient</a> than other types.</p>

            <p>LED bulbs are only a tad more expensive, but it&#8217;s an investment that pays off quickly due to their incredible efficiency and lifetime. More importantly, it reduces our power consumption and consequently our footprint. For reference, it&#8217;s estimated that LEDs could save the US population an estimated $<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">26</a> billion USD per year while cutting electricity consumption for lighting nearly in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">half</a>. Better policies could ensure that inefficient bulbs are swiftly replaced by LEDs in the near future, instead of relying on individuals to make the smarter choice.</p>
            <p>Second, we can simply be better with lighting. For large scales, that can mean automatic light sensors combined with taking full advantage of sunlight when/where possible. Smart building automation systems can cut energy consumption in large buildings considerably. For individuals, that just means using natural lighting as much as possible and turning lights off when they&#8217;re not in use.</p>
            <h5 id="water-heaters"><strong>Water Heaters</strong></h5>
            <p>Water heating accounts for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">16</a>% of residential energy consumption in select <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">IEA</a> developed countries, on average. While lowering the water heater temperature may sound like a good idea, it&#8217;s a tad more complicated than that. </p>
            <p>To improve water heating efficiency, building operators and homeowners can check the water heater&#8217;s temperature and make sure it&#8217;s at the lowest recommended setting. Doing so would result in less heat loss between the hot water tank and the surrounding air – and thus less energy would be required to continuously heat the water. Unfortunately, lowering it too much isn&#8217;t an option as it risks growing legionnaire&#8217;s bacteria.</p>
            <p>On top of adjusting our water heater settings, we can also try to reduce hot water consumption by either using less hot water or switching to colder water – or both. In any case, reducing hot water consumption can reduce energy consumption, since the water heater would have to replace less hot water in the tank. This can effectively reduce power consumption and emissions.</p>
            <p>Remarkably, water heaters allow other machines to appear quite eco-friendly [e.g. clothes washers, dishwashers]. For example, efficient dishwashers use around the same power as a hair <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">dryer</a> and can clean a load with around <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">10-20</a> liters of water, which is much less than what most hand washing individuals use. However, the dishwasher only looks cute because it hides its real energy demand behind the water heater [we&#8217;re not saying &#8216;hand-washers&#8217; don&#8217;t use hot water as well, this is just to point out that <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/water-heating/reduce-hot-water-use-energy-savings">hot-water-using</a> appliances consume energy].</p>
            <p>The same goes for hot showers and especially baths. Relatively small bathtubs need around 120 L of hot water per use. That&#8217;s the equivalent of a 20-minute shower for low-flow shower heads [at 1.6 gallons per minute = 6.1 liters per minute]. For higher flow rates, that&#8217;s closer to a 13-minute shower [at 2.5 Gpm = 9.5 Lpm].</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Governments can pass numerous policies that would effectively reduce our appliances&#8217; impacts. Companies can also contribute by producing better quality items that use less energy and last longer.</p>
            <p>As for individuals, there&#8217;s one common theme across all types of appliances. We can reduce our consumption by using household appliances sparingly and effectively in our day-to-day lives. To do so, we&#8217;ll have to look at our household items and evaluate whether their usage is worth wasting resources for. And most importantly, before purchasing any household appliance, we&#8217;ll have to ask ourselves one single question: do we really need it?</p>

For other appliances you use more frequently, it&#8217;s up to you. Just check to see if the power cords or plugs aren&#8217;t frayed first, to make sure it&#8217;s safe to do so. Also, make sure to pull on the plug itself and not the cable, to avoid damaging your cables [to be clear – not the metal part &#8211; pull the plastic exterior of the plug].</li><li><strong>Or at the very least turn the appliances off/put them in sleep mode when not in use.</strong></li><li><strong>Increase energy efficiency by avoiding redundancy.</strong> There are many opportunities to reduce energy consumption through increased sharing within a household – like doing a group laundry [instead of having individuals wash their clothes independently].</li><li><strong>Decrease your faucet or nozzle water flow rates.</strong> This essentially just means reducing the water speed from your nozzles or faucets.

            <p>While many view climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution as 3 distinct yet interconnected parts of the environmental crisis, we decided to split pollution within the first 2 sub-crises. Seeing that pollution usually forces one of climate change or biodiversity loss, it seems redundant to consider it separately. Nonetheless, we&#8217;ll quickly review pollution here to understand how different types of waste infiltrate and damage the environment. </p>
            <p>In general, pollution occurs when elements or compounds [or anything else they form] that harm the environment are released. These chemicals can be emitted as solids, liquids, or gases, but what do they actually do? How are they harmful to nature and to us?</p>
            <p>Well, that depends on the type of pollutant, the environment&#8217;s characteristics, and how both react with one another.</p>
            <h5 id="nature"><strong>Nature</strong></h5>
            <p>When pollution is emitted in the natural environment, it becomes a part of the ecosystem, even if just momentarily. Solids can degrade into the soil or ocean, liquids can seep into the ground and mix with other liquids, and gases can be powerful GHGs or react with other elements to form secondary pollutants.</p>
            <h5 id="gases"><strong>Gases</strong></h5>
            <p>Some gases emitted into the environment are primary emitters, which is probably what most of us think of when we mention gas emissions. However, other types of polluting gases exist – and are classified as secondary emitters. They may not be harmful as emitted, but they can still end up creating extremely polluting gases. For example, NO<sub>x</sub> [nitrogen oxides] gases and VOCs [volatile organic compounds] can react with one another to form ground level ozone. And although the ozone layer is essential to protect us from UV radiation, ground level [tropospheric] ozone is a completely different thing. It can cause serious health issues, large quantities of smog, and contributes to global warming.</p>
            <p>Gaseous pollutant emissions can cause loads of problems since we end up breathing them in. That&#8217;s no secret. We should all know by now that polluted air can deteriorate human health through a variety of diseases and illnesses [e.g. lung cancer]. Unfortunately, these types of emissions are also quite concerning because of their global warming potentials [GWPs – or &#8216;greenhousiness&#8217;], which we hope you&#8217;re familiar with by now.</p>
            <p>Air pollution [<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_3">indoor</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_2">outdoor</a>] is responsible for roughly <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1">7</a> million deaths every year. That&#8217;s equivalent to 12% of the total <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Mortality/">57.26</a> million deaths [yearly average from 2015-2020] recorded across the globe annually. That high percentage makes sense given that <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1">91</a>% of the global population lives in areas where the air quality is above WHO [World Health Organization] guideline limits. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s also important to note that gaseous pollutants aren&#8217;t all equal, as far as their greenhousiness goes. As we&#8217;ve seen in many sections, gases like methane can be much more potent than CO<sub>2</sub>. So far we have presented methane emissions as <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a> times more potent than CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over 100 years, but that doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. </p>
            <p>Methane actually doesn&#8217;t stay in the atmosphere for that long before being destroyed through natural processes [roughly <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">12.4</a> years]. However, it is a very potent GHG until then – which means it can cause significant warming in the first couple of decades after its release compared to CO<sub>2</sub>. In fact, it&#8217;s estimated that the greenhousiness of methane over 20 years is close to <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">84</a> [i.e. 84 times more greenhousy than CO<sub>2</sub> over 20 years]. Therefore, reducing our methane emissions can play a vital role in curbing global warming as soon as possible.</p>
            <h5 id="solids"><strong>Solids</strong></h5>
            <p>For solids, the effects of pollution vary. Solids can pose significant problems to wildlife if mistaken for food [e.g. turtles choking on plastic bags]. As the solids decompose into various toxic compounds, they end up polluting soils and aquifers – eventually damaging ecosystems and inducing biodiversity loss. They can also break down into smaller solids, as some pollutants create micro-particles that are proving difficult to detect and filter. </p>
            <p>As we&#8217;ve seen with micro-plastics in the ocean, microscopic waste particles can have devastating impacts on the environment – or even make their way up the food chain and into our bellies. Some of the micro-particles are so lightweight that they&#8217;re actually transported by gases and float around in our atmosphere. Unfortunately, this particulate matter can cause many health issues for all kinds of species when breathed in, including humans.</p>
            <h5 id="liquids"><strong>Liquids</strong></h5>
            <p>Like solids that have broken down, liquid pollutants can travel in water bodies and seep into soils – damaging ecosystems along the way [e.g. contaminating a water table]. Every day, factories legally discharge tonnes of contaminants into rivers and lakes, in the hope that the water body will help the pollutant decay or settle within a certain period of time. Unfortunately, this obviously threatens marine and coastal ecosystems through toxic pollution and/or eutrophication.</p>
            <h5 id="humans-and-cities"><strong>Humans and Cities</strong></h5>
            <p>When it comes to humans, pollution affects us differently depending on where we live. Let a sausage represent a random item that is produced in the world. </p>
            <p>There are populations in underdeveloped countries who see how the sausage gets made. Note that producing the sausage always has impacts on the environment. At the other end of the spectrum, there are the populations of developed countries that purchase and use the finished sausage. The finished sausage may or may not pollute while in use.</p>
            <p>When disposed of, the sausage either returns to pollute underdeveloped countries – or ends up polluting less in a developed country&#8217;s waste management system, where sausage disposal is more advanced.</p>
            <p>Those who witness the sausage making/disposal may live next to [or work in] lithium mines, clothing factories, or e-waste disposal sites. These people are living in environments saturated with air, water, and soil pollution. Only far away from the sausage factory/disposal site does the air quality begin to improve. Unfortunately, those closest to the sausage factory likely don&#8217;t have high-quality water purifying systems in place, so they get to drink polluted freshwater  – on top of breathing polluted air.</p>
            <p>The finished sausage users are luckier for the most part. With advanced water management systems, their freshwater supply is purified and seemingly endless, for now. As far as air pollution however, large city populations are at risk for some of the same health issues as the sausage factory workers – even in the most developed countries in the world. In fact, urban emissions from all sorts of sausages [e.g. combustion vehicles] can increase urban smog, particulate matter, and toxic pollution levels.</p>
            <p>Some areas of the world experience such high levels of constant pollution that it&#8217;s visible to the naked eye. In fact, highly populated developing cities in Asia often have such poor air quality that even sunlight has a tough time penetrating the clouds of pollution [i.e. global dimming]. Individuals living in these cities have increased chances of dying prematurely every time they step out of their home.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that there are other, less obvious forms of pollution. Particularly, noise and light pollution are inducing biodiversity loss by disrupting many species&#8217; instincts around mating, hunting, and surviving. While loud noises and artificial lighting are usually associated with urban areas, they&#8217;re becoming increasingly common in natural areas as well – due to encroaching human activities. </p>

            <p>As of January 1<sup>st</sup> 2021, there are around <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.8</a> billion humans on Earth. By 2064, the global population is expected to reach its peak, near <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620306772">9.73</a> billion [note that another estimate predicts <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_Highlights.pdf">10.9</a> billion by 2100].</p>
            <p>We&#8217;ve talked about agriculture, transportation, waste management, and many more important topics. In each section, the bottom line has always been that we need to reduce our energy/resource consumption to decrease our impacts on the environment. Successfully doing so would mean mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss. Additionally, most of the solutions we&#8217;ve presented stem from a basic concept that we were taught in kindergarten: sharing is caring. </p>
            <p>A growing population won&#8217;t help us reach sustainability or harmony with nature – but nearing 10 billion people is certainly manageable if we learn to share resources. Not just between humans, but with all the natural world.</p>
            <p>Population growth rates are less than half of what they were <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">50</a> years ago, but they&#8217;re still positive [i.e. population is increasing but less quickly].&nbsp;That&#8217;s mostly because lower birth rates are being countered by both lower death rates and a higher number of fertile women [less births/woman but more women counter each other]. </p>
            <p>The whole process where the population size increases, peaks, then decreases is called a demographic transition. With this global demographic transition almost completed, the older generation&#8217;s share of the population is set to increase every year for the foreseeable future. This means that the younger generations, including the ones being plopped out now, are likely going to be around for a while – and once they get old they&#8217;ll have a much stronger voice in our societies than our seniors do now. For that reason, we can&#8217;t mess up this next batch of humans. </p>
            <h5 id="education"><strong>Education</strong></h5>
            <p>We have to invest in our future to develop sustainable societies. Quality education around the globe will give us the best return on all possible investments.</p>
            <p>More than ever, developed and developing countries need to teach sustainability and environmental responsibility. Science, literature, history, and geography are all extremely important, but we need more courses that can help students relate &#8216;success&#8217; to other things than just money. Alas, that&#8217;s a hard lesson to teach when textbooks are extremely expensive – instead of being tools that encourage accessible learning for all.</p>
            <p>For companies that have positioned themselves as leaders of our modern societies, it&#8217;s important to remember that with great influence comes great responsibility to do good and help others, instead of exploiting the less fortunate and their resources.</p>
            <p>For environmental sustainability and prosperity, we&#8217;ll have to promote facts and intellectual curiosity over personal opinions. &#8220;Let&#8217;s agree to disagree&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work when scientists and experts that have spent their life in a field are opposed by village idiots.</p>
            <p>We&#8217;ll also have to be wary of &#8216;traditions&#8217; that are highly respected in certain areas of the world, but that keep parts of their population grounded. A prime example in many cultures is the terrifying number of young girls married off to much older men – before they have a chance to complete their basic education and get out of the flytrap. Another good example would be voluntary homeschooling, where kids are often quickly secluded from the world and other sources of information. That&#8217;s great for parents that are looking for a clone, but wouldn&#8217;t it be best to let the kids learn all sorts of stuff so that they can make up their own mind when faced with contradicting pieces of information?</p>
            <p>Covid-19 deniers, anti-vaxxers, and Q-anon supporters are a few of the latest examples of systemic distrust in our governments – without any tangible proof. Listening to these supporters speak with confidence shows how vital quality education is. In some of the most developed countries on Earth, it makes no sense that such a significant share of the population would lose a &#8216;Tic-Tac-Toe&#8217; game against an 11th century serf.</p>
            <p>When we say we need everyone to be educated, we mean it. Half the population won&#8217;t do. Women need to have the same access to education as men to transform the society that didn&#8217;t let their mothers learn, work, drive, or earn equal wages. The same goes for minorities.</p>
            <p>There&#8217;s an extremely visible correlation between a region&#8217;s education quality and its birth rates. Low-quality education typically leads to high birth rates of children who will also receive poor education, if any. This vicious circle has been broken in many parts of the world, but not everywhere.</p>

            <p>In addition, increasing sex education and access to contraceptives are 2 surefire ways to reduce population growth anywhere in the world. </p>
            <p>Education impacts the way we treat one another, and how we co-exist with nature. One example is the way we hunt down pangolins, among many other poached animals.

            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>

                Money&#8217;s going to play a pivotal role in solving the environmental crisis. Money&#8217;s the reason things get done in our capitalist societies, and that&#8217;s great for a lot of people. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also the reason a lot of eco-friendly solutions don&#8217;t get done – and that impacts everyone and everything on Earth. </p>
                <p>While many of the solutions we&#8217;ve presented can help individuals save money, that&#8217;s not always the case. Especially at large scales, where reducing emissions and protecting ecosystems seem to just add costs compared to &#8216;business as usual&#8217; operations [we&#8217;ll see why that&#8217;s not a very fair statement in a later sub-section]. </p>
                <p>That&#8217;s a problem – but things change quickly in the wild world of finance. In this section, we&#8217;ll discuss 2 ways that money can become a powerful tool to help solve the environmental crises. Combining that with previous sections, we&#8217;ll discuss a few of the challenges that our money-centered societies will face as we attempt to reduce our impacts on the environment.</p>

                <p>Some GHG-reducing projects can have important capital/operating costs. In those scenarios, the company that manages the project can enter contracts with other individuals/companies/municipalities that wish to help fund these projects – in return for tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e removed [carbon credits]. </p>
                <p>For example, a company can fund a forestation project at a pre-defined cost per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>e removed [e.g. $20/tonne]. This way the company that manages the forestation project can afford to continue planting trees and expand operations, in exchange for some carbon credits.</p>
                <h5 id="why-purchase-carbon-credits"><strong>Why Purchase Carbon Credits?</strong></h5>
                <p>Well, some people want to help reduce impacts on the environment, for whatever reason [e.g. good intentions, building an eco-friendly reputation, not exceeding emissions limits]. </p>
                <p>Carbon offsets are a solid way to help do that, anywhere in the world. GHG-reducing projects take place in almost all ecosystems and countries – which allows us to pick and choose how we want to reduce our impacts as well [e.g. mangrove restoration project in Southeast Asia, RNG plant in Western Canada]. </p>
                <h5 id="challenges"><strong>Challenges</strong></h5>
                <p>Unfortunately, carbon offsets are riddled with challenges. We&#8217;ll go over a few of their most important limitations here.</p>
                <p>First, a project&#8217;s potential emission reductions need to be calculated. While that seems like an obvious preliminary step, it can actually be near impossible to predict how much &#8216;GHG removed&#8217; can be credited. For example, there&#8217;s no telling how long carbon can be locked up in soil and biomass, so how can we set a price tag for carbon credits when planting trees? Between extreme climate events, future policy changes, and straight up poor forestation techniques, there&#8217;s no guarantee that those carbon offsets will make any long-term difference [e.g. wildfires ravaging forestation projects, land use conversion of green ecosystems]. The same uncertainty goes for non-natural projects, where the amount of GHG reduced by energy-efficient equipment can depend on a multitude of factors [e.g. energy consumption]. </p>
                <p>In both cases, measuring carbon offsets based on inaccurate assumptions can lead to serious ineffectiveness in our fight against climate change. In other words, we might be  wasting money on inefficient measures – when there are better alternatives instead.  </p>
                <p>Second, following carbon credits around the world can be extremely complicated. With projects on every continent, offsetters can easily buy carbon credits to reduce their emissions. The problem is though, they&#8217;re not physically reducing their emissions. </p>
                <p>For example, a New York skyscraper that funds a renewable energy generation project in Paris is still emitting GHGs – since it&#8217;s still consuming energy in New York through the local electricity and natural gas grid. And while the skyscraper could claim to be running on 100% renewable energy [given that they purchase enough carbon credits], they&#8217;re still very much emitting GHGs into the atmosphere. </p>
                <p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how carbon offsets can help shift the responsibility of GHG emissions onto others, and how complicated this global web of interconnected carbon credits can get. While the math of who&#8217;s contractually responsible for who&#8217;s emissions works out, there&#8217;s something very wrong about projecting our own &#8216;actual&#8217; emissions onto someone else. In our example, the skyscraper provides renewable energy to Parisians, but also shifts its own &#8216;real&#8217; emissions onto them [without the skyscrapers, Parisians would not enjoy renewable energy – so in a sense the skyscraper owns the Parisians&#8217; lower emissions.].</p>
                <p>Third, carbon credits are essentially a mitigation strategy that can help high-energy consumers not change their ways. At the end of the day, we need to reduce consumption to reduce emissions. If carbon credits are simply viewed as small &#8216;reputation&#8217; fees by large companies to keep their polluting practices and customers the same time, then carbon offsets aren&#8217;t doing their jobs. </p>
                <p>Lastly, the global reach of carbon offsets can have additional consequences. Profit-driven carbon offsetting can be extremely sloppy and have impacts of its own, far from the public eye. We&#8217;ve already seen examples of this in an earlier section when discussing poor forestation techniques. </p>
                <p>Some have dubbed the impacts of remote carbon offsetting projects on local populations as &#8220;<a href="https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/carbon-colonialism-failure-green-resources-carbon-offset-project-uganda">carbon colonialism</a>&#8220;, where underdeveloped communities [that emit much less than we do] are forced to move/change their way of life so that developed countries can offset their emissions. As carbon offsets take a more significant role in our societies, we&#8217;ll have to make sure that these remote projects don&#8217;t cause more harm than good.</p>
                <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
                <p>Faced with numerous challenges, it&#8217;s pretty clear that carbon offsets won&#8217;t solve the climate crisis on their own. They can be useful in certain situations, but should never be regarded as suitable alternatives for on-site emission reductions. Reducing emissions at the source ensures the GHGs are never emitted in the first place, so there&#8217;s no carbon storage issues. On-site measures also help reduce complexity and ensure money isn&#8217;t wasted on a poor offsetting scheme, while avoiding any underlying impacts that cheap carbon offsets can cause to underdeveloped communities. </p>
                <p>Carbon offsets offer a false sense of security that can lead to inaction in our fight against climate change. Inaction is simply not an option. Capturing most of the carbon we&#8217;ve emitted in the past few centuries with green ecosystems will be hard enough. If we continue to justify our current GHG emissions based on the carbon storing potential of vegetation [e.g. through forestation-type carbon offsets], then we won&#8217;t even get close to reducing GHG atmospheric concentrations. At best, we&#8217;d only be ensuring they don&#8217;t increase [in a hypothetical net-zero emissions scenario that is still very far away]. </p>
                <p>While carbon offsets can and will help reduce emissions, we have to use them responsibly – only after on-site emission reduction measures have been taken, as a &#8216;top-up&#8217;. </p>

                segmentBody: `
                <p>Green investments are investments that help promote eco-friendly companies. Whether that&#8217;s achieved by investing more heavily in low-impact companies [weighting] or refusing to invest in high-impact companies completely [negative screening] – the goal is the same. And while negative screening is usually more effective than weighting to reduce our impacts, both methods can help individuals and companies invest more responsibly– and can be used simultaneously. </p>
                <p>Green investing is becoming increasingly popular nowadays, especially for long-term investments. It&#8217;s a relatively easy way to make a significant difference. And with large companies switching to more sustainable practices, it&#8217;s becoming less risky and more profitable than it was decades ago. </p>
                <p>With more and more investors taking an interest in sustainability, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before extremely polluting investments are dropped – when looking at long-term options at least. Betting on unsustainable companies just doesn&#8217;t make sense when shaping a sustainable future.</p>
                <h5 id="challenges"><strong>Challenges</strong></h5>
                <p>There&#8217;s a reason it&#8217;s pretty easy to make a big difference by moving money around. Individuals can simply shake up their investment portfolios by themselves in a few clicks, or by calling their bank. That&#8217;s convenient, but there&#8217;s still a fundamental problem. How are individuals/banks supposed to know which companies are sustainable?</p>
                <p>As we&#8217;ve seen in quite a few sections, transitioning to more sustainable societies is complicated and has a lot of moving parts. As such, it would clearly be unreasonable of us to expect that bankers and individual investors are sustainability experts – or even know how to research a product&#8217;s life-cycle impacts. Luckily, some companies have developed &#8216;sustainability metrics&#8217; that can help banks and individuals evaluate the impacts of numerous companies. Unfortunately, these metrics often don&#8217;t consider the entire life-cycle&#8217;s impacts, so it&#8217;s hard to know for sure if a company is eco-friendly [we&#8217;ll see in a later section why assessing companies can be challenging]. </p>
                <p>That being said, these metrics can still help us identify some of the most polluting companies in our portfolios – so there&#8217;s no excuse to keep investing in them.</p>
                <p>With more and more companies intent on reducing their impacts on the environment, separating companies that offer truly sustainable products from the rest will become increasingly challenging. And that&#8217;s not an investor&#8217;s fault. Green investing is a mash-up of 2 very complicated fields that require many experts and typically don&#8217;t work well together [we&#8217;ll see why in the next sub-section]. </p>
                <p>It&#8217;s also important to note that green investing doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean higher returns on investments. Even though sustainable products should be the way of the future, wishful thinking doesn&#8217;t guarantee good investments [after all, they remain investments].</p>
                <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
                <p>There&#8217;s no question that green investing will be extremely important as we move forward. For now, we can rely on removing the most polluting companies from our investment portfolios to stop supporting them with our investments. This relates to the expression: &#8220;If you&#8217;re not investing responsibly, you&#8217;re investing irresponsibly&#8221;. However, to take that a step further and truly promote sustainable companies while avoiding wasting time/money on other companies – sustainability metrics are going to have to improve considerably to allow green investors to make informed decisions.</p>

                <p><em>Note that this short sub-section refers to many concepts we&#8217;ve already discussed in the <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/energy-and-the-economy/">Resources and the Economy</a> section.</em></p>
                <p>As we&#8217;ve seen in the previous sub-sections, a few &#8216;money-centered&#8217; solutions already exist and can help us reduce our impacts on the environment. Unfortunately, each have their own set of challenges – most notably the lack of certainty that the offset/invested money really ends up making a difference. </p>
                <p>To transition our societies into more sustainable ones, we&#8217;re going to need to make massive investments to restructure our energy supply, cities, and food/water systems. While some of those investments may pay off, it&#8217;s important to understand that highly sustainable societies won&#8217;t increase GDPs. Being mindful of our planet&#8217;s finite resources just isn&#8217;t compatible with economies built for infinite growth – it&#8217;s the exact opposite.</p>
                <p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean we have to choose between a strong economy or a healthy environment. Rest assured, the planet&#8217;s resources are finite no matter how we decide to deal with the environmental crisis. The choice we do have, is whether we want to reduce our impacts on the environment now, or later once we find out the hard way that we can&#8217;t keep extracting resources unsustainably. By transitioning as soon as possible, we give ourselves time to adapt to a declining economy so that individuals don&#8217;t have to suffer the consequences [on top of the whole environmental crisis aspect].</p>
                <p>Effective transitions require enormous investments from governments and significant consumption reductions from companies and individuals. As we&#8217;ve seen in numerous sections, large-scale solutions will be crucial to affect meaningful change swiftly – but we can&#8217;t forget that they&#8217;re reliant on support from the population. As such, it&#8217;s up to individuals to stand up for more sustainable policies to influence large-scale decision making. Alas, even then there are a few obstacles – such as political lobbying by polluting companies, or well-intentioned decision makers that have no expertise on sustainability [e.g. politicians, CEOs, large investors] and can end up doing more harm than good. </p>
                <p>In any case, we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of spending trillions of dollars to solve the environmental crisis. After all, the more we spend now to reduce our impacts, the less we&#8217;ll have to spend later to supply populations with food/water – or to clean up after increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters [e.g. in 2019, floods alone caused $<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000375724&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_db06f7c4-b33f-4833-be56-bbf54afdee3f%3F_%3D375724eng.pdf&amp;updateUrl=updateUrl6935&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000375724/PDF/375724eng.pdf.multi&amp;fullScreen=true&amp;locale=en">36.8</a> billion USD in economic losses worldwide]. And very importantly, we&#8217;ll avoid irreversible damage to our environment and save countless human lives by transitioning to more sustainable societies as soon as possible.</p>

Our economies are built around it, as each decade we produce and trade more products than the last.

            <p>Currently, mining and refining pollutes. The steel &amp; iron industry alone accounted for 5.8% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 – while mining sites for all metals find ways to pollute locally as well. Additionally, metals are natural resources, so extracting them will deplete available stocks and increase metal costs as mining companies move on to extract the next deposit.</p>
            <p>Renewables and high-tech will be partly responsible for this increased mining activity, and many governments&#8217; proposed climate action plans will have serious consequences.

            <p>Mining is an extremely important primary industry that supports our modern societies during development. Mining is the first step before building, expanding, and growing civilizations. It&#8217;s also the backbone of the modern global economy, since inventing new products is one of the main drivers of growth in our societies. </p>
            <p>Aside from metals, there aren&#8217;t that many strong materials we can use to make durable stuff – so many products rely heavily on mining activity. The most notable exceptions are products made of wood/plants, animals, or plastic – but these aren&#8217;t great alternatives in times where deforestation induces biodiversity loss, livestock increase food demand, and plastic waste pollutes many ecosystems. In addition, different metals have specific properties that can make them the ideal material for many products [e.g. electricity conductors in high-tech devices]. </p>
            <p>Our economies are based on growth and expansion, which means we&#8217;re going to keep pumping out products at an ever-increasing rate. Especially as developing countries continue to grow and their populations get richer. This will undoubtedly increase metal demand.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the ambitious climate change targets set by countries around the world will require a considerable amount of metal. Green tech like solar panels, wind turbines, or electric vehicles are made from many different metals, some of which are quite rare. </p>

            <p>This upcoming &#8216;green revolution&#8217; alone is projected to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">double</a> clean tech&#8217;s current mineral demand by 2040 under our present policies – or up to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">6 times</a> our current demand by 2040 if the world aims for net-zero emissions in 2050 [or <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">4 times</a> the current demand in the Sustainable Development Scenario].</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, metal recycling <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">won&#8217;t</a> really help reduce primary supply that much, especially for high-tech devices [with our current technologies and waste management systems]. We&#8217;ll see why in detail in later sections, but the bottom line for now is that even with increased efforts and innovation in recycling processes worldwide – mining activity will still boom. </p>
            <p>Procuring the metals required to transition to renewable technology will be difficult enough, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there. These technologies have the added challenge of &#8216;expiring&#8217; every <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-footprint.html">20-40</a> years – so we can&#8217;t just complete the transition and stop mining [since recycling isn&#8217;t a perfect solution]. Note that the increasing digitalization of our societies is also increasing metal demand [e.g. sensors, IoT devices, servers, etc&#8230;].</p>
            <h5 id="a-few-clarifications"><strong>A Few Clarifications</strong></h5>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to be able to differentiate metals, minerals, ores, and rocks. Minerals are what&#8217;s being mined from rocks. They&#8217;re found in different concentrations [&#8216;grades&#8217;] – where higher concentrations mean the mineral is abundantly present within the rock. Minerals are considered &#8216;ores&#8217; when mining them is profitable. After extracting mineral ores, metals can be retrieved using different methods, but most are energy-intensive and polluting. Metals can then be mixed together to make alloys.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s also important to understand the difference between reserves and resources. A mineral reserve is the amount of mineral that we know exists and that we can mine for the current market price. In other words, reserves are the known profitable mining sites. A mineral resource, on the other hand, is the amount of mineral we know exists and could theoretically be mined in the future [i.e. there has to be a somewhat accessible mineral deposit]. Mineral resources are much larger than mineral reserves.</p>
            <p>Typically, reserves are more profitable than resources [at any given point in time] because the minerals are found in higher grades. Hence, depleting reserves usually <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/reliable-supply-of-minerals#abstract">leads</a> to the mining of lower grade mining sites.</p>
            <p>Note that the same resource vs. reserve difference exists for metals, but requires the added step of estimating how much metal is contained in the mineral ore being mined. </p>

            <p>Faced with an ever-increasing demand, the mining rate continues to grow. Since recycling doesn&#8217;t affect mining activity too much, we&#8217;re going through reserves at a furious pace. These reserves are <a href="https://visitors-centre.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/media/tools/materials-that-are-critical-to-our-green-future">depleting</a>, meaning that some metals are becoming rarer – and are therefore becoming more valuable. As the price for these metals rises, mining companies can afford to mine other sites that have now just become profitable, because they can sell the metal at higher prices. With this system, it would seem that we won&#8217;t be running out of metals in the near future, since we can just tap into the extremely large resources every time reserves are depleted. </p>
            <p><strong>Impacts</strong></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that takes a toll. Mines pollute all along their life-cycle, contributing to both climate change and biodiversity loss. Between metal leaching, acid rock drainage, tailing dam failures, decreases in the local water table elevation, dust and noise pollution, and vibration caused by mining blasts – it&#8217;s clear that mines can pollute their environment in a number of ways. As for unregulated mines, and mines that end up exceeding their &#8216;close &amp; clean-up&#8217; budgets, it can get much worse.</p>
            <p>While mineral extraction requires energy [often provided by fossil fuels], that usually isn&#8217;t the most energy-intensive step in the metal production process. That accolade goes to the refining plants, where metals are extracted from their mineral ores. These plants employ energy-intensive and/or chemical-heavy processes to separate the metals – so that&#8217;s not great. Additionally, there may be multiple steps required before being able to produce the final metal, which only increases energy consumption [as is the case for steel or <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/aluminium">aluminum</a>]. </p>
            <p>High energy requirements mean high pollution levels, especially when fossil fuels dominate the industry&#8217;s energy mix. For example, the iron &amp; steel industry accounted for roughly 5.8% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 [<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">2.1</a> of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">36.42</a> billion tonnes], with coal meeting <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/iron-and-steel">74</a>% of the industry&#8217;s energy demand. Alas, many metals are even more polluting than iron &amp; steel per unit weight produced– but fortunately their demands aren&#8217;t as high as iron &amp; steel&#8217;s.</p>

            <p><strong>Back to It</strong></p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s get back to the ever-increasing metal production. The continuous opening/depletion cycle of mining sites works if metal prices increase – and if that doesn&#8217;t reduce demand too much [i.e. increasing a product&#8217;s cost so far that customers would no longer buy it]. As metals become more valuable, their minerals become profitable in lower-grade deposits and/or at less accessible sites. Unfortunately, extracting metals in those conditions <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">increases</a> energy-intensity, production costs, GHG emissions, and waste volumes – which all have significant impacts. And even if slight advances are made to mitigate metal production impacts, our rising material demand will still lead to increased pollution within the sector – for decades.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, companies can try substituting the depleting resources with more common metals – but that&#8217;s not always an option. Modern day products are made from an <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/archive-2014-2015/smartphones.html">insane</a> number of different metals, all used for their specific properties. Some of these metals just aren&#8217;t substitutable, while others can be replaced – but the product then loses efficiency. That makes sense since we&#8217;ve been using the most cost-effective metals for the job, so switching to anything else now is usually worse.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that lowering efficiency can mean increasing mining rates. For example, we&#8217;d need far more low-efficiency solar panels than higher-efficiency ones to generate a given amount of electricity.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s also important to note that there is another option, which is hoping that we&#8217;ll innovate our way out of problems by finding more efficient materials at lower costs. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re too short on time to just cross our fingers and hope that innovation will save us. And besides, this type of solution isn&#8217;t sustainable forever either. </p>
            <p>Switching from one finite resource to the next may have short-term benefits [e.g. switching to more abundant metals, reducing costs], but in the end the new reserves will deplete as well. And at that point, we&#8217;ll need to innovate an even better solution to avoid losing cost-effectiveness through substitutions or by mining lower grade deposits [which isn&#8217;t sustainable since infinite efficiency advances aren&#8217;t possible – on top of dealing with finite resources].</p>
            <h5 id="renewables-and-high-tech"><strong>Renewables and High-Tech</strong></h5>
            <p>Transitioning from fossil fuels to metal-intensive renewables will certainly shake things up. We already know how important energy is in our societies. To confirm, we can just look at how some countries have based their entire economies off of selling a single &#8216;king&#8217; fossil fuel [e.g. oil-rich Middle Eastern countries], somewhat successfully we might add. If countries follow through with their renewable energy targets, and the majority of the global energy mix shifts to renewables – then mining will soon become king [especially in an increasingly digital world due to high-tech devices]. And while reducing carbon emissions remains a priority, we need to consider the green revolution&#8217;s collateral damage before going all-in.</p>

            <p><strong>Rare Earth Metals</strong></p>
            <p>To help evaluate renewables and their mining impacts, we need to introduce rare earth metals. These types of metals aren&#8217;t all that rare, but like many metals that are key to the green revolution – they&#8217;re rarely found in high concentrations [i.e. low-grade mineral ore and/or low metallic content within the ore]. And unfortunately, extracting lower-grade minerals and producing metals that have lower-metallic concentrations can have <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/reliable-supply-of-minerals#abstract">higher</a> mining and refining impacts.</p>
            <p>These rare earth metals are used in almost every high-tech product and renewable energy technology for their unique properties [often in very small amounts – yet play vital roles in our devices]. Unfortunately, just a few of them are substitutable, and alternatives are far less efficient. These rare metals are <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">clearly</a> indispensable for the green revolution – and consequently their demand is set to skyrocket as renewable technologies start their long journey to phase out fossil fuels. </p>
            <p>The following graph shows how clean tech&#8217;s metal demand [including rare earth metals] will face an incredible boom in the next couple of decades.</p>

            <p>Although transitioning to renewable-dominated energy mixes will definitely help reduce carbon emissions now – increased mining activity will increase the mining sector&#8217;s environmental impacts. Similarly, switching to renewable energy within the mining and refining sector would effectively reduce carbon emissions [e.g. with renewable-powered mining equipment]. However, that will require more mining – which will mean more renewable energy is required, and so on.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s a problem when dealing with finite resources like metals. Our increasingly consuming and metal-intensive societies will eventually face metal scarcity [either when the metals become too expensive for consumers or when extraction struggles to meet demand] in the absence of unrealistic circular economies. While it can take a few decades or even over a century to get to that point, it doesn&#8217;t make our current mining demand any more sustainable. And by increasing energy consumption year after year, we&#8217;re only reducing the amount of time we have before we reach metal scarcity. Time we could spend to voluntarily lower our dependence on energy – before we&#8217;re forced to anyway.</p>
            <p>Without mentioning that increasing energy consumption will make our goals of phasing out fossil fuels much harder and lengthier.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>If we put all our eggs in the same basket with renewables and mining without any long-term plans [e.g. reducing consumption, enforcing unprofitable recycling for renewables and high-tech, etc&#8230;], we&#8217;ll realize the hard way that metals are finite resources just like fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>By voluntarily reducing consumption, we give ourselves time to adapt to lower-energy societies, without giving up too much of our current lifestyles. If we continue in our current consumption modes instead and eventually reach a point of metal scarcity, we won&#8217;t be prepared for a world where we not only use less, but need less. Transitioning to a world like that takes time and foresight, or the consequences can be pretty destructive. </p>
            <p>Of course, transitioning to renewable technologies is essential to reduce GHG emissions, which remains the priority. However, once we stop viewing mining impacts as just &#8220;being better than fossil fuels&#8221;, we&#8217;ll realize that fossil fuels aren&#8217;t the root cause of the problem. We simply can&#8217;t sustain this level of energy and material demand for infinite decades. And it&#8217;d be mighty cool of us to come to that conclusion sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p><em>For reference, the chart below should help visualize which countries will play a large role in the world&#8217;s upcoming energy transition. Politics will be a determining factor in our global race for decarbonization and will ultimately decide if metal supply will be a problem in the near future or if our common interests will prevail – regardless of whether the green revolution is sustainable long-term or not.</em></p>

                segmentBody: `<p>Renewable energy is the future. There&#8217;s simply no denying that we have to stop burning fossil fuels if we want to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. However, renewables have their limits.</p>
            <p>Solar PV, wind, and battery technologies are all made from loads of different metals. As such, many of the components&#8217; production processes are polluting and energy intensive. Some of the metals – arguably the most important ones – are also quite rare and are listed as &#8216;critical&#8217; commodities. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t just build millions of solar panels and wind turbines to solve the energy production problem for the next 100 years. These technologies have expiration dates, and combined with poor recycling, that means we need to keep extracting and smelting minerals to produce these &#8216;clean&#8217; energy technologies. These limits help explain why solar PV and wind [combined] accounted for less than 8% of the global electricity mix in 2019. Solar thermal has yet to make an impact at the global scale.</p>
            <p>Hydrogen-based technologies also face numerous challenges, ranging from infrastructure,  overall efficiency, and hydrogen production&#8217;s high costs and energy requirements. With an overwhelming majority of industries using steam-methane reforming to produce hydrogen, the lightweight fuel is far from clean right now. Meanwhile, hydrolysis has its fair share of obstacles to overcome before it can start taking a more significant role in hydrogen production worldwide. </p>
            <p>Geothermal, like hydroelectric energy sources, just aren&#8217;t options in many parts of the world. Hydroelectricity continues to dominate energy production amongst renewables, but isn&#8217;t scheduled for a significant increase in energy production in the coming decade. Hydroelectric dams also damage surrounding biodiversity and indirectly emit methane as decaying organic matter accumulates on the reservoir floor. Lastly, dams are at the mercy of precipitation, which is becoming increasingly problematic since climate patterns are becoming less predictable.</p>
            <p>Biomass and renewable natural gas can both be great options to convert waste into energy. However, that&#8217;s really as far as it should go. Intentionally cutting down vegetation for that purpose just doesn&#8217;t make much sense from a carbon emission perspective. </p>
            <p>While all these renewable energy sources/technologies will be necessary to phase out fossil fuels, they each have their limits. To reduce our energy consumption&#8217;s impacts, it&#8217;ll take more than just switching energy sources. We&#8217;ll need to reduce our consumption significantly to help the energy mix make a quick transition from a domination of fossil fuels to a majority of renewables. </p>
            <p>For people living on the grid, it&#8217;s usually best to avoid purchasing individualized solutions. Instead, reducing consumption while demanding change at larger scales [e.g. governments, businesses] is a much more effective solution.</p>`

            <p>Renewable energy will help us decarbonize our atmosphere, but all technologies have their limits. In this section, we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the most popular renewable solutions to find these limitations – in terms of environmental impacts and energy generation potential. Overall, renewable energy alone won&#8217;t help make our societies sustainable. If we want to attain sustainability, renewables will help – but are only one part of the solution. The much, much larger part will be reducing our impacts by consuming less of the world&#8217;s resources – by lowering both our energy and material demands.</p>
            <p>When evaluating each of these technologies, remember that everything we make requires extracted materials and energy to be manufactured/transported. Green technology is a prime example for showing the importance of life-cycle assessments [which we&#8217;ll talk about in a later section]. While most green technologies are still being called &#8216;clean&#8217; because they don&#8217;t pollute while generating electricity, we&#8217;ll see that other stages of their life-cycle can have significant impacts.</p>
            <h5 id="solar-wind-and-batteries"><strong>S</strong>olar, Wind, and Batteries</h5>
            <p>In 2019, solar PV [photovoltaic] accounted for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-gross-electricity-production-by-source-2019">2.6</a>% of electricity production worldwide. Solar panels convert solar energy into electricity, thanks to engineered materials like semi-conductors. </p>
            <p>In 2019, wind turbines accounted for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-gross-electricity-production-by-source-2019">5.3</a>% of electricity production worldwide. Wind turbines have a gear system connected to a generator, where the mechanical energy is eventually converted electricity. They&#8217;re usually very tall since wind speeds increase with elevation.</p>
            <p>These technologies don&#8217;t emit any pollutants in the atmosphere when producing energy, so what&#8217;s the catch? </p>
            <p>Well, they pollute tonnes of GHGs and toxic compounds during their production. And that&#8217;s mostly because they need very specific materials to function, including high amounts of rare metals [low mineral grade deposits and/or low metallic concentration within the ore].</p>
            <p>Solar panels are made from a wide range of metals [depending on the type of panel] <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/critical-mineral-commodities-renewable-energy">including</a> arsenic, copper, gallium, germanium, indium, and/or tellurium to name a few of the critical ones. Solar panels use a bunch of silicon as well, which may be considered abundant – but is <a href="https://visitors-centre.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/media/tools/materials-that-are-critical-to-our-green-future">rarely</a> found in its pure form.</p>
            <p>Wind turbines are giant metallic structures [<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">mostly</a> composed of zinc and copper] that also depend on a few &#8216;<a href="https://visitors-centre.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/media/tools/materials-that-are-critical-to-our-green-future">critical</a>&#8216; commodities, like dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium [all used for turbine magnets], aluminum and rare earth elements. For reference, the typical onshore wind plant is made with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">9 times</a> more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not all. Both technologies are intermittent, since the Sun doesn&#8217;t shine all day, and wind varies too. That&#8217;s why energy storage is essential to provide a continuous energy supply throughout the 24-hour day. This is where batteries come in. </p>
            <p>Chemical batteries store energy chemically and release it as electricity. Unfortunately, these types of batteries are also metal-intensive and require several critical materials such as cobalt, graphite, nickel, rare earth metals, and of course lithium [for lithium-based batteries]. Battery storage systems will play an important role as we look to decarbonize our societies, as clearly indicated by their <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions#abstract">increasing</a> metal demand. </p>

For example, the clean-tech sector&#8217;s lithium demand is expected to increase 42-fold by 2040 [i.e. clean-tech&#8217;s 2040 lithium demand will be 42 times its 2020 demand].</p>

            <p>Even if we&#8217;re able to extract all the necessary metals to help renewables overtake fossil fuels, there&#8217;s still the issue of lifetime. Solar, wind, and batteries use technologies that damage over time, so they need to be replaced every <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-footprint.html">2-4</a> decades, at most [e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51325101">wind</a>]. Consequently, if we choose to complete the &#8216;green revolution&#8217; and deplete many metal reserves, we better have a plan for how to manage the second/third/next waves of the revolution.</p>

            <p>Solar thermal [or concentrated solar power – CSP] is another type of renewable technology that depends on solar power, but focuses on capturing solar heat – which can then be used to generate electricity. This technology currently isn&#8217;t making an impact at the global scale, as it faces many practical challenges of its own [e.g. isolated in deserts but requires water] – <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24d5dfbb-a77a-4647-abcc-667867207f74/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf">in addition</a> to some of those listed above. In 2018, solar thermal generated just <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/concentrating-solar-power-csp">13.4</a> TWh [terawatt hours measure quantities of energy] of electricity – compared to <a href="https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/solar">570</a> TWh for Solar PV.</p>
            <h5 id="hydrogen"><strong>Hydrogen</strong></h5>
            <p>Hydrogen has gained so much clout over the past few years that some companies and governments have decided to <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2017/pdf/1226_003b.pdf">switch</a> over to this semi-renewable energy &#8216;source&#8217;. It&#8217;s already being produced and used by industries for other applications than electricity generation, and that&#8217;s expected to ramp up in the next few decades.</p>
            <p>Hydrogen isn&#8217;t really an energy source – or at least that depends on how it&#8217;s retrieved. If it&#8217;s made through hydrolysis, then it acts like a battery. If it&#8217;s stripped from natural gas, then it&#8217;s basically just a fossil fuel. Once hydrogen has been produced/separated by either method, it can store energy [much like a propane tank] until it&#8217;s used to generate electricity with a fuel cell. While the electricity generation through a fuel-cell won&#8217;t emit any pollutants, we should note that fuel cell manufacturing <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">requires</a> loads of metals as well [e.g. platinum-group metals].</p>
            <p><strong>Fuel Cells</strong></p>
            <p>Through chemical reactions, a fuel cell provided with hydrogen and oxygen can generate electricity.&nbsp;The beauty of a fuel cell is that their only by-products are clean water and heat. Quality fuel cells are around <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf">50-60</a>% efficient, compared to less than <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf">20</a>% for internal combustion engines [we&#8217;ll soon see why that&#8217;s not a very fair comparison]. With oxygen abundantly present in air [21%], the fuel cell can simply intake nearby air, use the oxygen, and release the air&#8217;s other gases that weren&#8217;t needed. So far so good. However, hydrogen is required as well. And no, we can&#8217;t take this one from air.  </p>
            <p><strong>Making Hydrogen Part 1: Hydrolysis</strong></p>
            <p>There are essentially 2 ways to produce hydrogen: the way people think of when they say hydrogen is clean, and the way that&#8217;s actually being used [yes there are a few more &#8211; see below]. Let&#8217;s start with the &#8216;clean&#8217; one, hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is the opposite reaction of what happens inside a fuel cell. This time, it&#8217;s the electricity and water that are consumed to create oxygen and hydrogen. There&#8217;s an apparent obstacle right from the get-go with this method – we need to supply electricity. The yield for this reaction is around 80%, meaning that 20% of input electricity is wasted. Combining this hydrogen production method with a fuel cell, the overall process only reaches 40-48% efficiency [e<sup>&#8211;</sup><sub>in</sub> vs. e<sup>&#8211;</sup><sub>out</sub>]. Compared to &#8216;normal&#8217; lithium batteries that are 80-95% efficient, fuel cells from hydrolysis would require roughly twice the electricity for the same final energy output.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re at a time where we can&#8217;t afford to increase energy consumption, especially in regions where fossil fuels continue to hold a significant share of the electricity mix. While hydrolysis is considered clean by many, it all depends on where that electricity comes from. And if you&#8217;ve been following along, &#8216;clean&#8217; technologies all have production impacts. Even with renewables, we can&#8217;t afford to double our electricity consumption with hydrogen. </p>
            <p>We could even go one step further and examine the initial electricity production efficiency at the power plant, and compare the whole process against just burning gasoline in combustion engines – taking transportation as an example. We find that with a standard <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf">33-35</a>% combustion power plant efficiency, the overall efficiency for hydrolysis-hydrogen reaches 13.2-16.8% – similar to the &#8220;less than <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/fcto_fuel_cells_fact_sheet.pdf">20</a>%&#8221; previously stated for combustion engines. </p>
            <p>In 2019, hydrolysis accounted for less <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen">0.1</a>% of hydrogen production worldwide – an insignificant share compared to other production processes that consume gas, coal, or oil.</p>
            <p>With hydrolysis, it&#8217;s pretty clear that hydrogen acts more like a shitty battery than an actual energy source, since &#8216;normal&#8217; lithium batteries have 80-95% charge/discharge efficiency – while the hydrolysis/fuel cell combo described above remains below 50% [excluding electricity production]. We should also note that hydrolysis electrolysers have important metal <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">requirements</a> [e.g. zirconium, nickel] – on top of relying on metal-intensive fuel cells later on. That being said, &#8216;normal&#8217; batteries are metal-intensive as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Making Hydrogen Part 2: Steam-Methane Reforming</strong></p>
            <p>Since hydrolysis is so inefficient [and currently expensive], the vast majority of industries adopt steam-methane reforming [SMR] instead. Most natural gases are hydrocarbons, meaning they&#8217;re composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Gases like methane have 4 hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom [i.e. CH<sub>4</sub>]. SMR plants strip the hydrogen from the carbon in the natural gas to &#8216;produce&#8217; hydrogen. The carbon ends up as CO<sub>2</sub> and eventually finds its way into our atmosphere in the absence of rare carbon control measures.</p>
            <p>This type of hydrogen production is far more efficient than hydrolysis, even though it requires high energy input for the reaction to occur – which explains why it accounts for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen">75</a>% of global hydrogen production. Stripping natural gas essentially saves 2 steps compared to hydrolysis, since there&#8217;s no need to burn natural gas to make electricity, which would then allow hydrolysis to produce hydrogen.</p>
            <p>Alas, between the carbon emissions and SMR&#8217;s high energy requirements, this process is far from clean. And it looks even worse considering that 40-50% of that hydrogen ends up wasted in a fuel cell afterward.</p>
            <p><strong>Tying It All Back Together</strong></p>
            <p>Once the hydrogen is made, there are still a few challenges left. Notably, hydrogen lacks the infrastructure to be easily transported. While it could certainly be transported in pipelines, other transportation methods are inefficient due to the safety risks associated with driving trucks filled with flammable gas. For example, if hydrogen were to replace gasoline as the fuel of choice, then truckloads of liquid hydrogen would have to supply fueling stations, but liquefying hydrogen requires lots of energy. Same goes for trucks that transport compressed tanks of hydrogen – compressing the gas consumes energy [which adds to the inefficiencies]. </p>
            <p>Hydrogen research and technology haven&#8217;t made any advances that would suggest hydrogen is the fuel of the future. Instead, it has uncovered disappointing truths, which should eliminate it from contention all together. Some exceptions exist – where hydrogen used in the right setting shows some potential to reduce emissions [e.g. smelting]. However, as long as hydrogen production pollutes our atmosphere – what&#8217;s the point? </p>
            <h5 id="geothermal">Geothermal</h5>
            <p>Geothermal [not to be confused with geo-exchange which relies on thermal energy generated from solar radiation], as the name indicates, consists of using the heat present in the Earth. The heat is extracted by heating a fluid to generate steam and rotate turbines. Alas, we&#8217;re not able to dig very deep into the Earth, which explains why geothermal energy production is limited to regions of high geothermal activity, like Iceland.</p>
            <p>As a result, geothermal energy cannot be produced in enough locations to take on a significant part of the world&#8217;s energy mix. In fact, geothermal accounted for less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-gross-electricity-production-by-source-2019">0.5</a>% of electricity production worldwide in 2019.</p>
            <p>We should note that geothermal is also pretty <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24d5dfbb-a77a-4647-abcc-667867207f74/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf">metal-intensive</a>, mostly due to the special steel alloys required [geothermal has <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24d5dfbb-a77a-4647-abcc-667867207f74/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf">high demands</a> for chromium, nickel, molybdenum, and titanium].</p>
            <h5 id="hydroelectric"><strong>Hydroelectric</strong></h5>
            <p>Hydroelectric dams use a very simple principle to produce energy: gravity. Upstream, a dam retains the water elevation much higher than on the other side of the dam. The higher the difference in elevations, the greater the pressure differential. Passing through the dam, the water rotates turbines to generate electricity. Out of all renewable energy systems [excluding biofuels &amp; waste], it holds the greatest share of the world&#8217;s energy mix with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2020">2.5</a>% [in 2018] and electricity mix with <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-gross-electricity-production-by-source-2019">16</a>% [in 2019]. Hydroelectricity is a flexible electricity source, since we can vary the amount electricity produced quite well [within design limits]. This helps increase generation for peak demand and avoid waste during off-peak hours [i.e. the dam can act as an energy storage system].</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there are significant drawbacks.</p>
            <p>First, dams must be placed along rivers or similar water bodies. There needs to be an upstream and a downstream, so that an accumulation of water can take place. Ecosystems are completely shaken by such installations. Access to a water source is vital for all living species, so modifying the water body seriously endangers many species both upstream and downstream [e.g. water quality and quantity, breeding grounds, etc&#8230;]. That includes human populations that depended on the previous water stream&#8217;s characteristics to survive. For example, the world&#8217;s largest dam in China forced <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45019893">1.4</a> million people to relocate between the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45019893">13</a> cities, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45019893">140</a> towns, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45019893">1,350</a> villages flooded by the reservoir. </p>
            <p>The larger the dam, the more energy can be produced. However, this also implies more water accumulation, which results in more damage to the environment. </p>
            <p>The rate of installation of new hydroelectric dams is decreasing while removal rates rise, as developing countries are starting to realize that many dams are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46098118">uneconomical</a>. Hydropower isn&#8217;t expected to reach its target of <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/hydropower">5,722</a> TWh of electricity produced per year by 2030, although it was already generating <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/hydropower">4,333</a> TWh in 2019. Not fantastic news for the world&#8217;s current largest renewable energy source.</p>
            <p>Second, there are many regions that don&#8217;t have access to water bodies that could prove good dam locations. Even if hydroelectric dams can help supply select regions of the world with nearly all their electricity, not everyone can follow suit. For hydroelectricity to dominate the electricity mix, we&#8217;d need plentiful access to rivers combined with sufficient unpopulated space and biodiversity to spare. Unfortunately, the Earth&#8217;s surface is fully booked at the moment.</p>
            <p>Third, dams are often at the mercy of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/hydropower/#close">precipitation</a>. With increasing global temperatures, droughts are becoming more frequent and intense. That forces regions to rely more heavily on fossil fuels during times of drought – when the dam&#8217;s water elevation isn&#8217;t high enough to produce more electricity than the dam uses to operate. </p>
            <p>Fourth, hydroelectric dams create reservoirs of decaying organic matter. Just upstream of the dam, loads of dead vegetation and animals accumulate on the reservoir floor. The decay process consumes oxygen and releases GHGs. This can significantly lower the oxygen content of the water, which is kind of a bummer for fish downstream since they depend on oxygen as much as we do. The GHG emissions are also far from negligible. While better reservoir management practices can significantly reduce those emissions, many dams aren&#8217;t up to par. This explains why certain regions of the world have cleaner hydropower systems than others, which has made it difficult to quantify hydroelectricity&#8217;s emissions [ranging from roughly <a href="https://www.hydropower.org/publications/2018-hydropower-status-report">0.16</a>&#8211;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/66/11/949/2754271">2.4</a>% of the world&#8217;s <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions">yearly GHG emissions</a>].</p>
            <p>Although hydroelectric dams are a great alternative to fossil fuels in select locations, they have serious side effects to consider. Installing a new dam would prove costly for biodiversity, while maximizing efficiency on the existing ones would not be without consequences either.</p>
            <h5 id="biomass"><strong>Biomass</strong></h5>
            <p>Biomass can be considered renewable, but it&#8217;s certainly not a clean fuel source. Biomass [for energy production purposes] is just wood and other organic matter grown from farms or forests that end up producing energy [e.g. biomass burnt at power plants, ethanol from corn mixed in gasoline, etc&#8230;]. Biomass may seem renewable, but we certainly don&#8217;t have time to make the industry sustainable.</p>
            <p>Governments around the world are considering using biomass to slightly reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, that wouldn&#8217;t make sense from a carbon emission standpoint. For an equivalent energy output, burning wood [including a proper life-cycle analysis] can be <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden,%20von%20der%20Leyen,%20Michel,%20Suga%20&amp;%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20(February%2011,%202021).pdf?dl=0">2-3</a> times as carbon emitting as fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s true that this carbon was initially absorbed from the atmosphere, so we could make biomass renewable if we started planting vegetation for that purpose. However, it would take too much time and space to start this process now, for something that really doesn&#8217;t provide that much energy. In addition, planting &#8216;compensation forests&#8217; would assume that the vegetation being cut down for energy production has the same value as the vegetation being planted to compensate – which isn&#8217;t true since vegetation plays many important roles in an ecosystem [i.e. not just in the carbon cycle]. For example, replacing a tree cut down in Brazil with another tree planted in Finland isn&#8217;t really a fair deal as far as Brazilian biodiversity is concerned.</p>
            <p>Biomass also uses a considerable amount of arable land, which is not something we have the luxury to spare. When burned, it can release other pollutants in the atmosphere as well, just like fossil fuels. To truly help the environment, we should help preserve vegetation while it&#8217;s still alive – a much more efficient way to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss rather than burning our environment.</p>
            <p>One of the only good reasons to use biomass and harness its energy is if the biomass would instead be wasted. And one of the best ways of converting organic matter into energy and fertilizer is by producing renewable natural gas.</p>
            <h5 id="renewable-natural-gas">Renewable Natural Gas</h5>
            <p>Renewable natural gas [RNG] sure has an interesting name. It&#8217;s mainly produced by landfills, industrial manure ponds, and anaerobic digester plants [e.g. for sewage treatment] during the decomposition of trash and organic waste. This RNG can then be injected into the natural gas grid to be burned like &#8216;normal&#8217; natural gas. When burned, RNG still releases CO<sub>2</sub>, so what&#8217;s so renewable about it? </p>
            <p>The renewable aspect comes from the assumption that RNG can replace some natural gas in the grid, thus lowering &#8216;normal&#8217; natural gas consumption. This logic only holds if we assume that the amount of energy supplied by the RNG would have been supplied by natural gas anyway. It also only makes sense if we assume that the RNG would have been released in the environment if it hadn&#8217;t been captured and burned. </p>
            <p>Those are 2 pretty reliable assumptions. With RNG eventually being consumed [releasing energy and CO<sub>2</sub>], the assumed RNG emissions are reduced by a factor of around <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a>, since the main component of RNG [methane] is <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a> times more greenhousy than CO<sub>2</sub>. While that&#8217;s great for general types of landfills, this waste-to-energy process might not be the best for organic matter. Quite simply, because there are other ways to deal with organic waste that don&#8217;t produce methane in the first place. </p>
            <p>One of the other ways to deal with organic waste is by composting it. This process produces some CO<sub>2</sub> instead of methane and helps us respect nutrient cycles – an essential component of sustainable agriculture. We should note that anaerobic digester plants can also recover nutrients from organic matter, so the main difference between both methods of dealing with organic waste is the fact that RNG is produced in anaerobic [i.e. oxygen-less] conditions. </p>
            <p><strong>RNG – Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p>In both scenarios, CO<sub>2</sub> ends up being released into the atmosphere. In the case of RNG replacing natural gas in the grid, the CO<sub>2</sub> released by consumed RNG can technically be considered as offset, since natural gas would have been consumed anyway. In the case of composting, the CO<sub>2</sub> doesn&#8217;t offset anything – but well-balanced composting processes can prevent a good share of those emissions by locking up organic waste&#8217;s carbon into the compost product. Composting also has other benefits. Notably, the fact that it can provide nutrients in a much simpler process, which avoids inefficiencies and additional impacts [e.g. anaerobic digester plant construction, RNG leaks, etc&#8230;]. </p>
            <p>RNG production from anaerobic digester plants can offset some GHG emissions from energy production in the short term, while providing the nutrients required for low-GHG farming to take place in the long term. That being said, RNG is produced from waste [and it should stay that way – see biomass], which means it&#8217;s already limited in terms of how much energy it can provide. </p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>All these examples reflect an important problem in our societies: we simply consume too much energy for renewables to be able to replace fossil fuels. Lowering our energy demand worldwide will help renewables take a more important share of the energy mix. Failure to do so would lead to the continued domination of the Big 3 in the energy mix for many decades. </p>
            <p>Alternatively [without reducing consumption], attempts to replace all the energy supplied by fossil fuels would lead to the rapid depletion of other natural resources through any combination of the renewable solutions mentioned above. Keep in mind that global energy demand is projected to increase by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2017">30</a>% between 2017 and 2040. It remains to be seen if that 30% can even be covered by renewables or efficiency advances, or if we&#8217;ll have to increase raw fossil fuel consumption to keep up with demand.</p>
            <p>We&#8217;re well aware of the negative aspects of fossil fuels and agree they can no longer be burned. Unfortunately, each renewable solution comes with its own set of limitations. The current response to these limitations seems to be &#8220;innovation will find a way&#8221;. Oddly enough, we rarely come to the conclusion that this clean energy supply problem might not be one we can solve. Living on a planet with finite resources won&#8217;t allow us to produce infinite amounts of energy or the materials needed to harness renewable energy sources for very long.</p>
            <p><strong>Don&#8217;t Get It Twisted </strong></p>
            <p>We need to establish our priorities. Decarbonizing our atmosphere is vital, and this is something all renewable energy sources can help us with. However, we have to accept that this will have serious consequences – like increasing mining activity and biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s okay because we&#8217;re currently in a race against global warming and climate change, but looking at the small picture risks creating a lot more problems later – especially as we increase our dependence on finite resources like metals.</p>
            <p><strong>P.S. – Individuals</strong></p>
            <p>Renewables will be important as we attempt to transition from fossil fuels to these new technologies, but they aren&#8217;t great solutions at the individual scale. With finite resources, we shouldn&#8217;t expect to each have our own electric vehicle or solar panels – in fact it might be best not to. Instead, reducing our demand for energy and materials are concrete steps that guarantee results. On top of that, those of us that wish to source our energy from renewables can just purchase renewable energy &#8216;certificates&#8217; from large-scale suppliers.</p>
            <p>Now this isn&#8217;t always the case, especially in underdeveloped countries where large chunks of the population rely heavily on extremely polluting fossil fuels. In these types of scenarios, <a href="https://www.seforall.org/system/files/2020-06/MGP-2020-SEforALL.pdf">mini-grids and off-grid</a> renewables are small scale solutions that can play a significant role in cleaning up the electricity mix.</p>
            <p>Getting back to developed countries, individualized renewable solutions can be problematic for numerous reasons [including but not limited to]:</p>
            <ul><li>Individualized solutions are taking up materials from a finite resource pool. So that means less is available for others who might need it more [e.g. in underdeveloped regions where mini-grids/off-grid renewables could replace fossil-fuels]. </li><li>These technologies have significant impacts on the planet, and the benefits that some of these solutions bring may not be enough to make up for their life-cycle impacts. For example, installing a solar array on a rooftop can actually increase one&#8217;s impacts if the region&#8217;s electricity grid is already dominated by renewables. It&#8217;s best to let experts figure out where renewables would be beneficial.</li><li>Renewables will be much more efficient and eco-friendlier if employed at a large scale [or at least at the mini-grid scale] by experts, as they will have more knowledge on maintenance, recycling programs, and more. As such, rooftop solar for example – when managed by the grid – can be a very attractive solution. Additionally, policy changes can force a quick transition to better &#8216;renewable energy management&#8217;, yet another reason for renewables to be part of a large-scale system.</li><li>Individualized solutions don&#8217;t usually lead to energy consumption reductions – it often has the adverse effect. With peace of mind that the technology is completely clean [which isn&#8217;t the case], owners may not see any point in limiting energy consumption anymore. </li><li>These solutions can distract us from the real solutions by promising an unchanged world [e.g. same level of energy consumption] – but where the environmental crisis is solved. As we&#8217;ve seen, that just can&#8217;t work. There are far more effective measures out there that can actually help us reduce our impacts, and it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that our unsustainable daily routines need to change a bit [we&#8217;ll see many examples in the main sections]. </li></ul>
            <p>In the end, we will need these new technologies. However, we have to realize that many rely on energy-intensive industries – and quite simply have limited energy generation potential compared to our current consumption. So we&#8217;ll have to reduce consumption and use renewables as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p>We should also note that we don&#8217;t have time to just wait around for research to make efficiency advances for these technologies while we do nothing. Hoping for the best is good for waking up in the morning, but so is the prospect of implementing concrete solutions that are guaranteed to make a difference. </p>

        cardIntroduction: 'Renewable energy will help us decarbonize our atmosphere, but all technologies have their limits. In this section, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular renewable solutions to find these limitations – in terms of environmental impacts and energy generation potential. Overall, renewable energy alone won’t help make our societies sustainable. If we want to attain sustainability, renewables will help – but are only one part of the solution. The much, much larger part will be reducing our impacts by consuming less of the world’s resources – by lowering both our energy and material demands.',

            <p>With renewables and biomass accounting for less than <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2020">15</a>% of the world&#8217;s energy mix in 2018 and less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">30</a>% of the world&#8217;s electricity mix in 2019– a significant transition phase from fossil fuels to greener sources of energy will be necessary. Additionally, we&#8217;ve seen that renewables and other green technologies are limited, so we&#8217;re going to have to transition our societies into less consuming ones. </p>
            <p>Both of these transitions will take time, especially if we plan on maintaining the current quality of life levels in developed countries, and spreading that across the globe. There&#8217;s no sugar-coating it, that&#8217;s a problem. We&#8217;re running short on time and have to reduce our fossil fuel consumption considerably in the near future. With that in mind, we have to consider other energy sources, GHG-reducing processes, and automated energy optimizing software.</p>
            <p>In the following sections, we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the tools that can help us reduce our impacts while we transition into more sustainable societies – and for some tools, even afterward.</p>

            <p>Decarbonizing our societies won&#8217;t be enough to prevent further global warming and avoid irreversible damage from occurring to our ecosystems. While it will surely help mitigate the effects of both crises, the concentration of GHGs in our atmosphere is already too high. We need ways to pull GHGs out of the atmosphere to start reversing global warming [with negative GHG emissions], not just slow it down. Numerous carbon capture solutions can help with that during our transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and afterward.</p>
            <h5 id="carbon-capture-technologies"><strong>Carbon Capture Technologies</strong></h5>
            <p>Switching from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy will take time, especially since it&#8217;ll depend on how fast we can reduce our energy consumption. Even then, completely phasing out fossil fuels will likely be impossible [in the near future] since we&#8217;d need every country in the world to get on board – and frankly, some underdeveloped countries have bigger fish to fry right now.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, it&#8217;s safe to say that the 100% emission-free world that some had envisioned by 2050 is out of reach. However, carbon capture technologies can help reduce emissions coming from the remaining polluters. </p>
            <p>Theoretically, there are <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf">loads of ways</a> to capture carbon, but 2 technologies in particular stand out as the future of &#8216;artificial&#8217; carbon capture [i.e. not through basic natural processes]:</p>
            <ul><li>One of the most practical ways of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is by doing so at the source. For example, carbon capture can take place directly at a fossil fuel power plant, by separating CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases before combustion [for natural gas] or after combustion [for other fossil fuels]. </li><li>Alternatively, carbon capture can be achieved anywhere on Earth by filtering out CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by taking advantage of some of its chemical properties [&#8216;direct-air&#8217; CO<sub>2</sub> capture]. </li></ul>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that both these carbon capture systems require energy, which could potentially cause more fossil fuel extraction [and more consumption of other resources depending on the CO<sub>2</sub> capture method].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s pretty clear from the get-go that capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from a fossil fuel power plant&#8217;s emissions doesn&#8217;t help remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere – it&#8217;s more of an emission control measure if anything. Contrarily, direct-air CO<sub>2</sub> capture has the potential to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In any case, we have to look at where that captured carbon ends up before evaluating whether these systems are actually useful.</p>
            <p><strong><strong>Next Step &#8211; Storage?</strong></strong></p>
            <p>There are many schools of thought on what should be done with that captured CO<sub>2</sub>. Instinctively, we might think that burying it deep underground or on the ocean floor could be a good idea, but that&#8217;s proving harder than expected for many reasons. </p>
            <p>First, there&#8217;s been little financial incentive for it. As a result, we&#8217;ve been making <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-industry-and-transformation">very slow progress</a> in terms of how much CO<sub>2</sub> is captured per year. The buried CO<sub>2</sub> can&#8217;t be sold to anyone, so it relies on companies and governments wanting to store CO<sub>2</sub> out of the good of their hearts. However, as we&#8217;ll see in later sections – there are a few ways to incentivize that [notably through <a href="https://encyclopedia2.com/money-carbon-offsets/">carbon credits</a> and policy changes].</p>
            <p>Next, we&#8217;re not too sure how well we can store it underground, how long it will stay there, and if it will have any serious effects on the surrounding environment if/when it escapes from storage. And while there are other ways to store CO<sub>2</sub> [e.g. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/a-new-era-for-ccus#growing-ccus-momentum">in building materials</a>], the uncertainty around long-term storage will always remain a problem. Of course, if the CO<sub>2</sub> makes its way back into the atmosphere in the near future, then it&#8217;ll just have been a waste of resources and energy. </p>
            <p>That brings us to the last point, which is that capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> and storing it requires energy. And if that energy is sourced from fossil fuels, then we better make sure that the amount of carbon sequestrated permanently is worth it.</p>
            <p><strong>Next Step &#8211; Fuel?</strong></p>
            <p>To get rid of a few of these challenges, some companies have decided to forget the whole storing aspect of carbon capture. Instead, they&#8217;ve developed technology that can convert the CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon-based fuel. The clear advantage here is that there&#8217;s a financial incentive to capture carbon, since the fuel can then be sold like any other fuel. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s also a clear weakness to this strategy: the captured CO<sub>2</sub> will still end up in the atmosphere once the fuel is combusted. In the end, this technology is more of a CO<sub>2</sub>-efficiency measure than a carbon removing technology, since it just becomes a question of how much energy is produced per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted [that would depend on the amount of energy required to convert the CO<sub>2</sub> into fuel vs the amount of energy output by the fuel]. On top of just energy balances, we&#8217;ll have to be wary of other impacts this carbon capturing technology can have on the environment. For example, large freshwater requirements or equipment manufacturing impacts can seriously end up outweighing the technology&#8217;s benefits.</p>
            <p>Since that&#8217;s not carbon removal, we&#8217;ll move on to the best carbon capture system available. Unlike the previous systems, this cutting-edge technology has been around for billions of years and consistently shows great carbon removal rates. It receives all the energy it needs from renewable sources, shelters biodiversity, and has already been implemented worldwide: vegetation. </p>
            <h5 id="vegetation"><strong>Vegetation</strong></h5>
            <p>Vegetation [present in any ecosystem] is truly our greatest ally for carbon removal. Currently, vegetation absorbs around <a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">25</a>% of our yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
            <p>First, it&#8217;s by far the most cost-effective solution, since it stores carbon in biomass [e.g. trunk, roots] and soil free of charge. </p>
            <p>Second, we don&#8217;t have to do much. We just need to leave those valuable green ecosystems alone and restore those we&#8217;ve recently destroyed [carefully, to ensure it works long term]. If we play our cards right, this can also help improve biodiversity in select areas, by providing habitats for many species at once. Carbon capture and the rewilding of degraded areas are both on our to-do list. Why not hit two birds with one stone?</p>
            <p>Lastly, this type of carbon capture system doesn&#8217;t depend on a steady output of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from a fossil fuel plant, it just takes it straight out of the atmosphere instead. That means we can continue to store carbon long after we&#8217;ve phased out fossil fuels, which will be necessary. </p>
            <p>We should note that the scientific world seems divided on the topic of carbon sequestration rates in forests. It&#8217;s uncertain whether new or old forests absorb more carbon in a given year. Luckily, that doesn&#8217;t matter. Everyone can agree that old forests already hold enormous amounts of carbon and biodiversity, so cutting them down to plant young trees wouldn&#8217;t make any sense at all. If old forests were logged, they would simply emit stored carbon back into the atmosphere [even if efforts were made to minimize emissions], while causing significant biodiversity loss. In other words, protecting old forests is a priority. Then, planting/restoring new forests in currently unforested areas will help with carbon capture and rewilding  </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <p>One of the main problems is the uncertainty of how long the carbon will remain stored in the soil. Depending on a variety of factors [e.g. usually healthy soils are better], that can range from decades to centuries. </p>
            <p>Additionally, if the ecosystem is later cleared to convert the land for other purposes [e.g. intensive agriculture], carbon stored in biomass and soil can find its way back into the atmosphere. </p>
            <p>For both these challenges, as long as we develop and maintain good carbon storing practices over time [including not damaging green ecosystems], we can rest assured that vegetation and soils will act as carbon sinks. </p>
            <p>Growing and burning biomass to capture CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is another <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf">increasingly popular</a> carbon capture solution proposed by climate scientists. We&#8217;ll just need to make sure that the carbon released from burning biomass doesn&#8217;t return to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, as we&#8217;ve seen earlier in this section, figuring out where to store large amounts of captured CO<sub>2</sub> is harder than it looks. This solution also threatens to take up a lot of land and could degrade soils if biomass is grown unsustainably, so it might be best to concentrate on simpler alternatives.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>As is often the case, it seems that the most nature-based solution is the most sustainable and realistic one as well. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there are more financial incentives out there to destroy ecosystems than to protect them. That&#8217;s not really something that can be fixed by innovation. At some point, governments are going to have to look at the long-term carbon goals they&#8217;ve voluntarily signed up for, and make smarter decisions. For example, subsidizing carbon-to-fuel technologies with government funding seems unproductive when stronger regulations could force fossil fuel companies to invest in these lower-emission technologies out of their own pockets – instead of taxpayer reserves. As for carbon storage, governments will have to play a large role to make sure CO<sub>2</sub> capture becomes the norm quickly, either through positive [carbon credits] or negative [higher taxes and fees] reinforcement.</p>
            <p>In the future, we&#8217;ll need to adopt <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf">all carbon capture technologies</a> available to mitigate climate change – with a special focus on natural carbon sinks. If we don&#8217;t act fast enough to help our ecosystems remove carbon from the atmosphere, we&#8217;ll end up paying for it. While these ecosystem protection and strengthening measures certainly have a cost, it only represents a fraction of what we&#8217;d need to clean up after decades of climate-change-induced disasters. </p>

                <p>If we&#8217;re going to discuss how we can improve energy efficiency and reduce material consumption in our everyday lives, we better mention household appliances. In 2019, household appliances were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/appliances-and-equipment">15</a>% of final electricity demand worldwide.</p>
                <p>Most appliances are powered by electricity or natural gas, like fridges, stoves, and most barbeque grills. Along with HVAC systems, this explains why the residential sector&#8217;s energy consumption is dominated by natural gas and electricity use [residential excludes transportation].</p>
                <h5 id="residential-energy-consumption"><strong>Residential Energy Consumption</strong></h5>
                <p>In general, everything that can heat, cool, light, or move needs energy. Our homes receive that energy as gas or electricity from local grids. While burning natural gas certainly emits CO<sub>2</sub>, we shouldn&#8217;t forget that electricity isn&#8217;t always better. As we&#8217;ve seen in an earlier section, around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% of global electricity production in 2019 came from burning the Big 3 fossil fuels. </p>
                <p>Appliances like showers or faucets also require energy in the form of water pressure. Pressurization occurs in underground water pipes by pumps that consume <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/understanding-your-water-bill">energy</a> – but there&#8217;s not much individuals can do about that except reduce water consumption and check for leaks. There are similar &#8216;hidden&#8217; energy requirements for compressors, which are essentially just pumps for natural gas. </p>
                <p>Although most of us only pay energy bills once a month, we should always remember that our residential energy/water consumption emits GHGs and toxic emissions into our atmosphere – even before reaching our home.</p>
                <p><strong>A Bit More Context</strong></p>
                <p>Residential and commercial/public sectors, which rely on many household appliances, were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-electricity-final-consumption-by-sector-1974-2018">48</a>% of worldwide electricity consumption in 2019. While that&#8217;s definitely significant, we should note that electricity consumption only accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">37</a>% of residential energy consumption in OECD countries [i.e. developed countries] in 2018– which shows that lots of energy is consumed outside of grid-distributed electricity, even in developed countries.</p>
                <p>By reducing our individual energy consumption in our households, we can help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The cool part is that we can do it all while chilling in our pajamas. </p>
                <p>We&#8217;ve already talked about how our HVAC systems take up over <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/temperature-control/">half</a> of residential energy consumption [on average in IEA developed countries], so we won&#8217;t revisit this. Instead, in this section we&#8217;ll focus on the non-HVAC half of our electricity and natural gas bills.</p>
                <h5 id="electronic-devices"><strong>Electronic Devices</strong></h5>
                <p>Pretty much anything plugged into a socket consumes electricity. For most devices, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if it&#8217;s turned on or not [but obviously they draw more power when &#8220;on&#8221;]. When appliances and devices like TVs, microwaves, or chargers are off, it turns out they still <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> &#8216;standby&#8217; power from the socket. </p>
                <p>In 1998, <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">0.6</a>% of total OECD CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were caused by standby power from the residential sector of those countries. That&#8217;s roughly the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions coming from <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">24</a> million European-type cars the same year. </p>
                <p>Efforts have been made since to regulate standby power, with moderate success. For the last 20 years, governments around the world have implemented regulations to limit the standby power at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/Guidance%20document_Lot%2026_Networked%20Standby_clean%20FIN.pdf">0.5-1</a> W [Watt] per appliance. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not being respected by many manufacturers, as their products continue to <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> much more standby power than admissible.</p>
                <p>1 Watt isn&#8217;t a lot of power. The average US home consumes electricity at an <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3">average</a> rate of 1,215 W. Still, with all our household appliances combined – and accounting for the many appliances that don&#8217;t follow the 1 Watt-initiative – standby power can easily add up to <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/795944">1-10</a>% of our electricity bills. It can be even worse in commercial buildings that are flooded with electronic devices. </p>
                <p>Governments have to double down on limiting standby power. It&#8217;s not enough to simply have a policy in place if it isn&#8217;t respected by most electronic devices. As for individuals, one easy solution is just unplugging our appliances when we&#8217;re not using them. These types of individualized solutions aren&#8217;t very effective at bringing about meaningful change, but they can still help us reduce our personal impacts.</p>
                <p><strong>Dryers</strong></p>
                <p>There are also appliances like dryers that have somehow made their way into the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/ENERGY_STAR_Scoping_Report_Residential_Clothes_Dryers.pdf">vast majority</a> of households in some developed countries [e.g. US]. In these areas, dryers are marketed as the washing machine&#8217;s counterpart, making it seem like owning one wouldn&#8217;t make sense without the other. That&#8217;s simply untrue. Drying clothes on racks or on ropes has been done for ages, and 9/10 dentists say it works fine. On average, it takes 1-24 hours to dry clothes without a dryer, some of that depending on whether the clothes are dried inside or outside, and the type of material/thickness of the garment.</p>
                <p>We understand the need to live life on the edge, and waiting until we&#8217;re out of undies to do laundry is exhilarating [also good for the environment, laundry every 2 days is not a great plan]. However, doing laundry just before our last pair would help avoid using a dryer and will lower our electricity consumption. Lots of clothes aren&#8217;t even suited to go in the dryer anyway [women clothes seem especially shrinky], so everyone should already know how to air-dry clothes.&nbsp;If not, it&#8217;s a pretty straightforward process. </p>
                <h5 id="lighting"><strong>Lighting</strong></h5>
                <p>Like electronic devices, lighting is also included in our electricity bill. Globally, it&#8217;s estimated that lighting accounts for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">15</a>% of electricity consumption and <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/led">5</a>% of GHG emissions [note that lighting isn&#8217;t always considered an appliance]. Power consumption for lighting is extremely easy to reduce when you have access to electricity [i.e. when you don&#8217;t have to burn fossil fuels]. We&#8217;ll go over 2 easy ways to optimize your lighting efficiency and reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
                <p>First, we can replace our lightbulbs with LED bulbs. These types of bulbs are way more <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/how-energy-efficient-light">efficient</a> than other types.</p>

                <p>LED bulbs are only a tad more expensive, but it&#8217;s an investment that pays off quickly due to their incredible efficiency and lifetime. More importantly, it reduces our power consumption and consequently our footprint. For reference, it&#8217;s estimated that LEDs could save the US population an estimated $<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">26</a> billion USD per year while cutting electricity consumption for lighting nearly in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">half</a>. Better policies could ensure that inefficient bulbs are swiftly replaced by LEDs in the near future, instead of relying on individuals to make the smarter choice.</p>
                <p>Second, we can simply be better with lighting. For large scales, that can mean automatic light sensors combined with taking full advantage of sunlight when/where possible. Smart building automation systems can cut energy consumption in large buildings considerably. For individuals, that just means using natural lighting as much as possible and turning lights off when they&#8217;re not in use.</p>
                <h5 id="water-heaters"><strong>Water Heaters</strong></h5>
                <p>Water heating accounts for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">16</a>% of residential energy consumption in select <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">IEA</a> developed countries, on average. While lowering the water heater temperature may sound like a good idea, it&#8217;s a tad more complicated than that. </p>
                <p>To improve water heating efficiency, building operators and homeowners can check the water heater&#8217;s temperature and make sure it&#8217;s at the lowest recommended setting. Doing so would result in less heat loss between the hot water tank and the surrounding air – and thus less energy would be required to continuously heat the water. Unfortunately, lowering it too much isn&#8217;t an option as it risks growing legionnaire&#8217;s bacteria.</p>
                <p>On top of adjusting our water heater settings, we can also try to reduce hot water consumption by either using less hot water or switching to colder water – or both. In any case, reducing hot water consumption can reduce energy consumption, since the water heater would have to replace less hot water in the tank. This can effectively reduce power consumption and emissions.</p>
                <p>Remarkably, water heaters allow other machines to appear quite eco-friendly [e.g. clothes washers, dishwashers]. For example, efficient dishwashers use around the same power as a hair <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">dryer</a> and can clean a load with around <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">10-20</a> liters of water, which is much less than what most hand washing individuals use. However, the dishwasher only looks cute because it hides its real energy demand behind the water heater [we&#8217;re not saying &#8216;hand-washers&#8217; don&#8217;t use hot water as well, this is just to point out that <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/water-heating/reduce-hot-water-use-energy-savings">hot-water-using</a> appliances consume energy].</p>
                <p>The same goes for hot showers and especially baths. Relatively small bathtubs need around 120 L of hot water per use. That&#8217;s the equivalent of a 20-minute shower for low-flow shower heads [at 1.6 gallons per minute = 6.1 liters per minute]. For higher flow rates, that&#8217;s closer to a 13-minute shower [at 2.5 Gpm = 9.5 Lpm].</p>
                <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
                <p>Governments can pass numerous policies that would effectively reduce our appliances&#8217; impacts. Companies can also contribute by producing better quality items that use less energy and last longer.</p>
                <p>As for individuals, there&#8217;s one common theme across all types of appliances. We can reduce our consumption by using household appliances sparingly and effectively in our day-to-day lives. To do so, we&#8217;ll have to look at our household items and evaluate whether their usage is worth wasting resources for. And most importantly, before purchasing any household appliance, we&#8217;ll have to ask ourselves one single question: do we really need it?</p>

            <p>While switching from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy is crucial – it can&#8217;t be done until we reduce our consumption significantly. We&#8217;ll definitely have to reduce our demand across a multitude of industries to help with that, but there are also some essential activities/facilities in our societies that require energy, and always will. In those situations, to help reduce energy consumption while maintaining the current quality of life and services, we&#8217;re going to need energy efficiency.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence [AI] can be a fantastic tool to achieve energy efficiency at large scales. In this section, we&#8217;ll refer to AI as systems that perform data analytics to automate controls – not those that attempt to replicate human consciousness [wouldn&#8217;t be relevant to energy efficiency]. </p>
            <p>Typically, AI systems are optimizers. By collecting data and analyzing trends, AI algorithms [that humans have programmed] are able to &#8216;learn&#8217; cause/effect relationships. Consequently, by looking at data for previous activity/events and what&#8217;s happened after those events, AI systems can help &#8216;predict&#8217; what&#8217;ll happen in the future in similar situations. It&#8217;s pretty much a statistic-based guessing software. </p>
            <p>Then, most importantly, AI systems can send the most energy-efficient commands to equipment and devices, using those predictions. There are loads of examples of eco-friendly AI products already in application, ranging from the automation of rotating solar panels to follow the Sun throughout the day to maximize energy generation – to predictive heating and cooling controls that help minimize energy consumption in large buildings. By optimizing energy generation or consumption, AI helps us reduce energy waste. </p>
            <p>There&#8217;s no doubt that AI is and will continue to be a great ally as we reduce consumption to phase out fossil fuels. However, AI systems have impacts as well. The &#8216;smart&#8217; devices [e.g. IoT – we&#8217;ll see in a later section] that automate data collection, analytics, and send commands to energy generating/consuming systems are all made of rare metals, just like renewables. In addition, as we&#8217;ll see in a later section, the software aspects of this technology have hidden impacts due to the large volume of information that needs to be collected, sent, analyzed, and stored [more so during the learning phase]. And all of this being repeated at very short time intervals to ensure low-response times [to react to the current situation] and high accuracy of the AI predictions.</p>
            <p>Consequently, we need to evaluate where AI systems make sense, compared to where their impacts wouldn&#8217;t be worth the trouble. Generally, AI systems are great at large scales that need to maintain current services and standards, where the optimization of energy generation or consumption significantly outweighs all negative impacts. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s the opposite for small scales, where continuous use of AI wouldn&#8217;t really help avoid energy waste that much. Especially since there are much easier ways to reduce consumption at an individual scale – given that there&#8217;s no need to accommodate for regulations and industry standards [e.g. most individuals don&#8217;t need to hold indoor temperatures above 20°C during winter – whereas many office buildings currently do].</p>
            <p>AI can be a fantastic transition tool to help us phase out fossil fuels and reduce consumption long after we&#8217;ve switched to renewables. We just need to adopt it at the right scale.</p>

        cardIntroduction: 'With renewables and biomass accounting for less than 15% of the world’s energy mix in 2018 and less than 30% of the world’s electricity mix in 2019– a significant transition phase from fossil fuels to greener sources of energy will be necessary. Additionally, we’ve seen that renewables and other green technologies are limited, so we’re going to have to transition our societies into less consuming ones.',

            <p>Fossil fuel energy production is becoming less efficient every year, as we continue to deplete easily accessible reservoirs. Renewables, on the other hand, are becoming more efficient every year. We just need to be careful that improving their efficiency doesn&#8217;t damage the environment during the technology&#8217;s fabrication stage. In the near future, we will need to use both types of fuels to power our societies, until we can reduce energy demand enough to depend on renewables alone [i.e. once fossil fuels account for a negligible share of the global energy mix].</p>
            <p>There are numerous individualized solutions that we can adopt in our everyday lives to reduce our impacts on the environment and save money. Individuals that live on ends meet can find sustainable ways to save – to make living from paycheck to paycheck a little bit easier. Individuals that are in more comfortable financial situations can reduce their impacts even further, simply because they have the resources to do so. As we apply eco-friendly solutions, we&#8217;ll just have to make sure we avoid the rebound effect – to truly help lower resource and energy consumption worldwide.</p>

            In a world where fossil fuels threaten to raise global temperatures, we have to turn to renewable energy sources to prevent further GHG emissions. In a world where renewable energy is unable to supply enough energy to replace fossil fuels – and can also lead to pollution and biodiversity loss, what do we do?</p>
            <p>We reduce our demand as much as possible while striving for energy efficiency.</p>
            <h5 id="energy-extraction"><strong>Energy Extraction</strong></h5>
            <p>Efficiency is important when evaluating energy extraction processes. In essence, extraction efficiency is just a comparison between the amount of energy extracted and energy consumed during the extraction process. That seems simple, but it can get a little complicated since those amounts typically vary over time.</p>
            <p>For fossil fuels, burning easily accessible oil, gas, or coal sources leads to high efficiency, since little input energy is needed to retrieve the fuel. As easily accessible sources dry out, fossil fuels have and will continue to become more expensive, and associated energy costs will follow suit. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll stop extracting oil or other fossil fuels any time soon. Employing a similar supply/demand mechanism than metals [described in <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/mining/">Mining</a>], <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265203/global-oil-production-since-in-barrels-per-day/">millions</a> of barrels of oil could continue to be extracted daily for decades – if we don&#8217;t actively decide to phase them out of our global energy mix. </p>
            <p>There is a hard stop though, once the extraction efficiency lowers to uneconomical levels due to rarer deposits. At that point, we&#8217;ll likely have to say goodbye to fossil fuels. Again, it&#8217;d be much better if we separated from fossil fuels on our own terms before then. Not only to avoid further emissions as soon as possible, but also to adapt to a fossil-fuel-free world smoothly – a world that seems like science fiction due to our current dependence on fossil fuels and their products. </p>
            <p>For renewables, efficiency has improved considerably for multiple technologies, but many of these advances are the result of more complicated materials being used – which can increase a technology&#8217;s production/disposal impacts. As we complete our energy transition, we&#8217;ll just need to think a bit more about the entire life-cycle of renewables to make sure their challenges are being addressed. That&#8217;ll help us find the optimal ratio between renewables and lowering consumption.</p>
            <h5 id="energy-consumption"><strong>Energy Consumption</strong></h5>
            <p>Efficiency is also important after the energy has been extracted. Carpooling, adjusting your home&#8217;s thermostat, and opting for second-hand products are samples of an incredibly vast playbook of eco-friendly actions that can help us maintain a good quality of life while using less energy [i.e. increasing our energy efficiency]– and less of other resources as well.</p>
            <p>Of course, individualized solutions such as those listed above are only one small part of the solution. Changing policies and regulations will be crucial to quickly affect large scale change. As we&#8217;ve mentioned in a previous section, systemic issues require systemic solutions. Nonetheless, if individuals want to reduce their personal impacts on the environment, CyclopediApp can help.</p>
            <p>Identifying which actions we can take to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss can be challenging, as it takes research, planning, and time. Here, we&#8217;ll let you skip all of that and provide you with the information you need to make eco-friendly decisions that fit your lifestyle. As you apply these solutions, you&#8217;ll find yourself saving on electricity and water bills, and in other areas as well. </p>
            <p>However, we need to share the same goal of reducing our consumption and emissions. Using these solutions to increase energy efficiency should lead to energy savings – not the rebound effect.</p>
            <p><em>Note that the following caution isn&#8217;t intended for low-income families that could truly benefit from increased consumption.</em></p>
            <p>We need to be careful of the rebound effect. In the past, increasing energy efficiency has not led to a decrease in energy consumption. Instead of reducing our energy bills, we tend to take this as a green light to consume more. For example, when using the telephone was terribly expensive, conversations were held to a couple minutes at most. Now, we still pay excessive amounts to the phone companies, but for unlimited talking, texting, and data. We pay the same price, it&#8217;s just that the value of the service is increasing. Similarly, when dealing with energy efficiency, the rebound effect can push us to maintain our high energy consumption levels – or even increase them [e.g. increasing lighting usage because LED lights are more efficient than old lightbulbs]. </p>
            <p>Objectively, it is more efficient. Alas, we&#8217;re at a time where we need more than efficiency – we need savings. We need to reduce our raw consumption of energy and natural resources by avoiding the rebound effect to take a meaningful step in the right direction.</p>

            <p>That dotted blue line isn&#8217;t a projection, it&#8217;s what needs to happen to align with the 2030 SDS [Sustainable Development Scenario]. That&#8217;ll be a difficult task considering industrial production is expected to grow during that time. To reduce yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 8.5 to 7.4 Gt to align with the SDS, industry needs to reduce emissions on average by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">1.2</a>% per year until 2030.</p>
            <p>Again, a tough challenge considering industrial energy consumption has increased on average by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">0.9</a>% annually from 2010-2018. Efficiency alone won&#8217;t help us get to the SDS goal – we&#8217;re going to need to slow down our energy demand.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s not very surprising that energy consumption keeps on increasing, since material demand has been consistently increasing as well. The respective demands for aluminum, plastics, and cement have all increased by at least <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">250</a>% between 1990-2018. That&#8217;s 3.5 times the 1990 demand for those materials – less than 30 years later. Demand for steel isn&#8217;t too far behind, with a 2018 demand <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">136</a>% higher than in 1990.</p>
            <p>Industry accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">37</a>% of the world&#8217;s final energy consumption, with roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-and-efficient-heat-for-industry">2/3</a> of industrial energy demand being used for heat. In 2019, industry&#8217;s energy mix was dominated by fossil fuels at around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">69</a>%, followed by electricity at <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">21</a>%. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that much of this electricity was generated from burning fossil fuels as well, so fossil fuels actually account for more than 69% of the industrial energy mix. </p>
            <p>Solar thermal and geothermal, the technologies set to &#8220;revolutionize the industry sector&#8221; still account for less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">0.05</a>% of the industrial energy mix. Not too surprising considering that the renewable share of heat demand is only required to increase from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">9.5</a>% to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">13.2</a>% from 2018-2030 to align with the SDS.</p>
            <p>To recap, industry is extremely energy intensive and relies heavily on fossil fuels. Not a great combo.</p>

            <p>While we reduce our consumption at all scales, it&#8217;ll be essential for energy-intensive industries to make use of the best available technologies to maximize efficiency. At such an enormous scale, the slightest improvements can help reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions considerably. Remember that industries are nowhere near our individual scale, where our quest for more efficient products can easily end up polluting more.</p>
            <p>Better policies will be crucial to ensure that industries reduce their impacts swiftly.</p>

            <p>The top earners of the world emit much more than others, on average. As such, we can’t just blame population growth for the destruction of the environment – our unsustainable lifestyles are also a big problem.</p>
            <p>To lower our impacts on the environment, the top income earners will have to reduce their impacts. Of course, middle and bottom earners can adopt more sustainable practices as well, but the responsibility of reducing our impacts has to fall on the top earners. Quite simply, because they have the most potential for reducing their impacts and the resources to do so. Government policies and other large-scale solutions will have to make sure that the top income earners of the world reduce their individual impacts from non-essential activities.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that in developed countries, many individuals are part of the top 1% – while the vast majority of employed individuals are part of the top 10%. So it&#8217;s really up to developed countries to move away from their polluting lifestyles.</p>
            <p>Despite frequent efficiency improvements across all sectors, the world continues to consume more of the natural world, while emitting more GHGs in the process. With increasingly wealthy and demanding middle classes in developing countries, that makes sense. However, that&#8217;s only one part of the explanation. The other, much more worrying, is that developed countries continue to produce useless products at a furious pace – and consumers continue to purchase them. </p>
            <p>To decrease our consumption and our emissions, we’ll first have to stabilize the shifting baseline. Large-scale solutions will have an important role to play in that regard. They’ll have to help focus research, energy, and finite resources on things that can help close the gap between the top and bottom earners of the world – as well as secure a sustainable future for present and upcoming generations.</p>

            <p><em>While that remains true, this section evaluates our impacts by shifting all the &#8216;blame&#8217; onto individuals instead.

            <h5 id="the-gap"><strong>The Gap</strong></h5>
            <p>Rich people emit more. So much more that as a group, the top 1% income earners are responsible for over <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/34438/EGR20ESE.pdf?sequence=25">twice</a> the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the lowest 50%. There&#8217;s even an enormous gap between the top 1% and 2-10%, as the 1% emit roughly <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/34438/EGR20ESE.pdf?sequence=25">half</a> as much as the following group [despite being a much smaller group]. This shows that we can&#8217;t just blame population growth for the destruction of the environment – our unsustainable lifestyles are also a big problem.</p>

            <p><em>Note that &#8220;<a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">income thresholds in 2015 are according to US$ purchasing power parity in 2011</a>&#8220;: </em></p>

            <p>The figures above show that the top 1% income earners worldwide aren&#8217;t an elite club of billionaires. In developed countries, many individuals are part of the top 1% – and the vast majority of employed individuals are part of the top 10%.</p>
            <p>The fact that the top income earners emit much more CO<sub>2</sub> than others corroborates the fact that in 2010, just 10% of the population travelled <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter8.pdf">80</a>% of the global population&#8217;s total motorized passenger-kilometers [i.e. distance travelled by passengers across all transport methods that use a motor]. </p>
            <p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
            <p>The point of this section isn&#8217;t to blame and shame, it&#8217;s to show who has the most potential to reduce emissions. It&#8217;s almost reassuring that the top earners emit more, because they can afford to change their habits. The bottom 90% earners are too busy and too poor to live extravagantly polluting lifestyles – so there&#8217;s some form of justice that the top 10% need to get to work.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s easier said than done. Just like they can afford to lower their emissions, the highest income earners can also afford to avoid the consequences of climate change and pollution. &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; isn&#8217;t really accurate if only some people risk losing their livelihoods. </p>
            <p>Luckily, better policies can help with that. Enforcing higher taxes for the top income earners is an obvious first step, but that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t deal with unsustainable lifestyles. To manage that issue, governments can implement large-scale policies that aim to reduce individual impacts from non-essential activities [e.g. banning private planes, cruises, etc&#8230;].</p>
            <p>Now this isn&#8217;t to say that the bottom 90% won&#8217;t benefit from lowering their emissions. On the contrary, CyclopediApp suggests many ways for everyone to save on their bills. Nonetheless, many solutions just won&#8217;t apply to the bottom earners, and that&#8217;s obviously not a problem.</p>
            <p>To reach the +1.5°C&nbsp; goal [purple line in graph], it&#8217;s estimated that the top 1% need to cut their emissions by <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/34438/EGR20ESE.pdf?sequence=25">97</a>% by 2030. The following 2-10% need an <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/34438/EGR20ESE.pdf?sequence=25">89</a>% drop. The middle 40% need to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/34438/EGR20ESE.pdf?sequence=25">62</a>%, while the bottom earners could afford to <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">triple</a> it.</p>
            <p>Everyone can easily attain these goals within the given time frame, as the top earners have the resources to slash their emissions significantly. Using the solutions we&#8217;ve presented, you should be able to independently assess your emissions and potential sources for reduction, to make sure you&#8217;re at least doing your part for the 2030 goal. All the while advocating for change at larger scales of course.</p>
            <h5 id="closing-the-gap-vs-a-shifting-baseline"><strong>Closing the Gap vs. A Shifting Baseline</strong></h5>
            <p>Each decade, we consume more energy, extract more resources, and emit more GHGs than the last, even though we make &#8216;world-changing&#8217; advances in efficiency frequently. So what gives?</p>
            <p>Much of this is a result of the global middle class getting larger and wealthier. Although it seems like developed countries have reached a stable point in terms of energy demand, some developing countries are booming [in part due to delocalized industry – so not a completely fair assessment]. Their middle classes are getting wealthier, so they start to consume more, emit more, and pollute more. That doesn&#8217;t make them bad people or anything of the sort – developed countries&#8217; populations went through the exact same process decades ago. </p>
            <p>This only partly explains why we&#8217;re not reaching global consumption peaks. That part isn&#8217;t really a concern, we would hope that people around the world are able to increase their quality of life to a reasonable standard. </p>
            <p>A reasonable standard. The lack of any type of moderation or &#8216;sobriety&#8217; is the other part of the problem. We&#8217;ve gotten so used to making our lives easier with tools over thousands of years that we&#8217;ve never really considered what &#8216;enough&#8217; would look like. For most of us who don&#8217;t think of the environmental impacts of our actions, it&#8217;s almost natural to consume more to make our lives easier – as long as we can afford it. </p>
            <p>That&#8217;s especially the case when ads in the street, on our phones, during sporting events, between songs, or on our clothes keep pestering us to buy the latest products. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, combining this with growing middle classes in developed countries – we get completely useless gadgets being adopted in homes around the globe. What do you sell to someone who doesn&#8217;t need anything? Something they don&#8217;t need.</p>
            <p>This has created a shifting baseline for what populations of overdeveloped countries consider to be an acceptable quality of life. What were once considered extravagant and unnecessary purchases decades ago have now become expected commodities in most homes [e.g. TVs, dryers, etc&#8230;]. And although some developed countries seem to have their energy demand or GHG emissions under control at a constant level [likely due to offshore industries], that&#8217;s not enough – we need reductions. And with global energy demand projected to increase by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2017">30</a>% from 2017-2040, that&#8217;s going to be a challenge. </p>
            <p>To decrease our consumption and our emissions, we&#8217;ll first have to stabilize the shifting baseline. Large-scale solutions will have an important role to play in that regard. They&#8217;ll have to help focus research, energy, and finite resources on things that can help close the gap between the top and bottom earners of the world – as well as secure a sustainable future for present and upcoming generations.</p>

However, it can also be an extremely powerful tool in these times of global crises. Online posts circle the globe in an instant and have the potential to unite strangers from different continents to take action for an important cause.</p>
                <p>The number of internet users <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/high-tech-and-the-digital-realm/">rises</a> every day and it seems that influencers are spawning from every corner of the Earth just as fast.

                <p>Unfortunately, there are also influential individuals who don&#8217;t believe the climate and biodiversity crises are real – or important. These people aren&#8217;t experts on the matter, yet they report YouTube and Facebook quality statistics to their immense platforms to publicly reject climate change. What kind of message does that send? That we shouldn&#8217;t believe people who have spent their career studying something most of us wouldn&#8217;t understand? That we shouldn&#8217;t trust the very organizations we created to study global warming and climate change?</p>
                <p>It&#8217;s extremely important for influencers to think twice before they use their platform, since promoting indifference and conspiracy theories can have long-lasting consequences on blind followers.</p>
                <p>The same goes for people who would believe in almighty solutions, like building enough solar panels and batteries to save the world. Spreading false information about green-tech is a very easy way to strengthen &#8216;anti-renewable&#8217; stances. It&#8217;s easy to dismantle &#8216;miraculous solutions&#8217; with logical arguments, and that can be dangerous in front of an uninformed audience. If even a fraction of people come to the incorrect conclusion that renewables are rotten from top to bottom, then we&#8217;re not headed in the right direction [we&#8217;ll discuss climate change deniers and greenwashing in more detail in the next section].</p>
                <h5 id="good-influencers"><strong>&#8216;Good&#8217; Influencers</strong></h5>
                <p>Instead, we need to inform ourselves on the natural resources we depend on every day, the consequences of their exploitation, and the solutions that can steer us in the right direction.&nbsp;Only then can we make better choices as consumers, community members, and electors to help shape a better future.</p>
                <p>As consumers, we can reduce our personal impacts by purchasing less and opting for more sustainable products when available. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no way a single consumer can affect meaningful change at the large scales. </p>
                <p>That being said, social movements that rally many consumers for an important cause can be effective. Between attending protests, signing petitions, boycotting, or simply denouncing the large-scale decision makers online, there are many ways of pressuring governments and companies. Alas, while these types of community-based solutions can spark change quickly, they can be brushed aside by large-scale players even quicker. After all, how could individuals know that the &#8216;net-zero&#8217; goals announced by companies and governments aren&#8217;t all just tactics to keep consumers/investors/voters happy?</p>
                <p>To answer that question, we&#8217;ll have to keep looking at the policies that are being passed and crunch the numbers. That can help us determine which governments actually back up their sustainability goals and which don&#8217;t – instead of rating how much everyone &#8216;cares&#8217; based on empty promises. </p>
                <p>In the end, it will come down to how much we want to achieve versus how scared we are of getting involved and taking action. For individuals to have an impact at larger scales, we have to voice our support for better policies and vote for governments that listen. </p>

                <p>Deciding what to share online is a struggle, especially when trying to share reliable facts that stand out from the loads of crap on social media. Luckily, others have already made ready-to-share images that can help spread awareness of environmental issues – and their small-scale solutions. </p>
                <p>The UNEP [United Nations Environment Programme] and UnSchool of Disruptive Design partnered on a project to encourage individuals to share powerful statistics and individualized solutions to spark change. <a href="https://anatomyofaction.org/">The Anatomy of Action</a> aims to inform individuals of their impacts by focusing on 5 sectors: food, stuff, move, money, and fun. </p>
                <p>The &#8216;shareables&#8217; below are just 2 of the many images prepared by <a href="https://anatomyofaction.org/">The Anatomy of Action</a>. Raising awareness of environmental issues with reliably sourced information has never been easier. While many of their individualized solutions won&#8217;t help affect meaningful change on their own, they can be useful for individuals that wish to reduce their personal impacts.</p>

                segmentBody: `<p>Climate change deniers are people who either do not believe the climate crisis exists, or that it poses a significant threat to present and future generations [there are also people who are knowledgeable on the subject and just don&#8217;t care – we can&#8217;t pay too much attention to them]. </p>
            <p>For one reason or another, they&#8217;ve managed to persuade themselves that the climate crisis is made up – or that it&#8217;s a liberal movement. It&#8217;s important to understand that climate change deniers don&#8217;t base their arguments on reliable facts, so hearing them out really can&#8217;t hurt. </p>
            <p>In fact, we encourage climate change &#8216;acceptors&#8217; to have open-minded discussions with climate deniers so that they can identify at which point the difference in the thought process begins. Only then will we be able to present facts that matter, instead of always repeating the same truths [e.g. differentiating climate and weather instead of always  repeating that global temperatures are increasing].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s also important to understand that most climate deniers don&#8217;t use what we&#8217;ll call &#8216;primary&#8217; sources of information. Instead, many rely on arguments made by influential climate change deniers, who themselves source their faulty information from other &#8216;secondary&#8217; sources of information, like social media posts and blogs. That&#8217;s a problem, as we&#8217;re now seeing climate change deniers comfort each other with terrible information that makes loops and loops within their online feeds. Lies are recycled within their &#8216;woke&#8217; community with different fonts and wording – but that doesn&#8217;t make the pseudo-scientific arguments any less wrong. </p>
            <p>One of the main issues at hand is that climate acceptors can easily look up statistics from international panels of scientists and trusted organizations – yet still have to debate with climate change deniers that instead trust a recycled social media post originating from a random influential climate change denier.</p>
            <p>As such, the significant problem with influential climate change deniers is their blind fanbase. Those fanbases are made up of people who don&#8217;t understand the science behind climate change, yet voice opinions and state them as facts. That&#8217;s extremely frightening, especially since it&#8217;s not really their opinions. They just regurgitate the lies spread by influential climate change deniers on their platforms. These fanbases are being fed bullshit and are asking for seconds – and that&#8217;s one of the reasons we&#8217;re not making progress fast enough to curb GHG emissions.</p>
            <p>To avoid further irreversible damage to our environment, we&#8217;re going to need to be united. That will only happen if we aim to educate everyone using the trusted scientific organizations that we literally created for that reason. As long as a good chunk of the population continues to trust &#8216;leaders&#8217; who reject climate change based on evident economic incentive [or other ethically questionable motives] rather than trust unbiased international organizations who have nothing to gain – we&#8217;ll continue to struggle to implement environmentally friendly measures. It will be no one&#8217;s fault but our own if we fail to educate one another, but we [humans] won&#8217;t be the only ones to suffer as a result of our inaction.</p>
            <h5><strong>Greenwashing</strong></h5>
            <p>As is always the case, there will be people who take it too far. Until now, we&#8217;ve been led to believe that vegans are the extremists in our societies because of their abnormal lifestyles. Although it&#8217;s true that a lot of vegans can be pretty in your face about it, that&#8217;s not what makes someone an extremist. If anything, they&#8217;re the ones taking concrete steps by sacrificing their food freedom for a greater cause.</p>
            <p>In our book, what makes someone extreme is believing that we can make the switch from fossil fuels to renewables, without changing our habits. The problem is, that doesn&#8217;t sound nearly as hardcore as veganism because it has been presented as the uncontested solution to global warming for decades. At this point in CyclopediApp, we hope you&#8217;re familiar with at least a few reasons why that&#8217;s impossible at our current levels of material and energy demand.</p>
            <p>Going forward as we tackle environmental issues, we&#8217;ll need to scale back our optimism a bit. It gives too much power to conspiracy theories and climate change deniers worldwide who can easily pick apart the &#8216;green dream&#8217; with valid arguments.</p>
            <p>Instead, if we present the complete truth which outlines that renewables aren&#8217;t a perfect solution, then we can start taking meaningful action. We&#8217;ll be able to focus resources and concentrate renewables where they can help achieve the most GHG savings – instead of funding all kinds of innovative &#8216;green&#8217; projects that can end up doing more harm than good [again, not all of them].</p>
            <p>Contributing to greenwashing can be unintentional, but it can also be used to make a lot of dough. Green tech, like other tech, is an extremely profitable market – so we have to be wary of companies who claim to help, but are actually just exploiting more discrete resources. </p>
            <p>In any case, it&#8217;s important to educate yourself when in doubt. Googling a question doesn&#8217;t make you an expert, but if you can find reputable sources that corroborate each other, odds are that the information is correct [or close enough to get the point across].</p>
            <h5><strong>Labels</strong></h5>
            <p>One of the greatest challenges of this century will be properly evaluating emissions and environmental impacts. With this in mind, companies and governments have come up with labels to help consumers make more sustainable purchases and dispose of products appropriately. However, there&#8217;s still lots of work to be done, as current labelling techniques are lacking in more ways than one.</p>
            <p>There are loads of criteria that make labels &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;bad&#8217; – we&#8217;ll synthesize some of them here. </p>
            <p>First off, it&#8217;s important for consumers to be able to trust the companies making the claims. This means companies have to show full transparency [i.e. hide nothing], while making logical claims based on the data available all along the life-cycle. It&#8217;s also important for companies to only mention relevant impacts, excluding &#8216;sustainable initiatives&#8217; that are actually just required by law. Irrelevant information could otherwise be used to distract consumers away from the main problems. Next, it&#8217;s important for companies to make sure that consumers can easily spot the label and understand its significance – ideally before purchasing the product. </p>
            <p>There are many ways to make sure these criteria are respected for all the products we sell. Between relying on third-party certifications, adhering to international standards, and providing quantitative data in labels, there are plenty of opportunities for companies to gain the trust of consumers. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, as we&#8217;ve seen above with greenwashing – some companies will try to slip through the official certifications to maintain their polluting practices while keeping their reputations intact. This can include companies that refuse to reveal all their data to the public, continue to lie about their impacts, or make void claims about their products. This can be achieved through the use of terms like &#8216;eco-friendly&#8217;, &#8216;sustainable&#8217;, &#8216;low-impact&#8217;, and many more that don&#8217;t mean anything on their own. Without facts and quantitative data, these are just words that aim to cheat the label system and mislead consumers instead of adhering to official standards that rigorously evaluate data before handing out labels. </p>
            <p>Lastly, it&#8217;s important to note that disposal labels such as &#8216;recyclable&#8217; or &#8216;biodegradable&#8217; aren&#8217;t all that useful depending on where they&#8217;re recycled. For many products in many countries, it&#8217;s unclear which parts of a product are recyclable and which are not. Differentiating the recyclable components would help individuals sort their waste more effectively.</p>
            <p>There&#8217;s certainly a lot of work to do to improve labels on all types of products. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not much individuals can do about that, except demand for better and clearer eco-labels to improve purchasing decisions and waste management systems worldwide.</p>
            <p><em>The following criteria were identified by the <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/consumer-information-scp/product-sustainability-information-hub">One Planet Network</a> as the 10 most important principles for better product labels.</em></p>

                segmentBody: `<p>Year after year, reports show that we need to act now to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss, or it will be too late. Year after year, we don&#8217;t meet the goals we had set for ourselves. So how late is too late?</p>
            <p>That depends on your definition. It&#8217;s too late to prevent irreversible damage to many ecosystems, but it isn&#8217;t too late to prevent most of them from collapsing. It&#8217;s too late to prevent further global warming, but it isn&#8217;t too late to curb it to the +2°C goal. That&#8217;s both a blessing and a curse. </p>
            <p>The good side of the deal is that we haven&#8217;t dug ourselves a deep enough hole that we can&#8217;t get out of. That means there&#8217;s still time to save ecosystems and millions of species. The bad side is that we humans tend to procrastinate. It&#8217;s probably what we do best. For our environment that means we won&#8217;t take action until we feel threatened. And we won&#8217;t feel threatened until millions of human lives are in immediate danger, at which point it will already be too late save billions. </p>
            <p>The issue with global warming, climate change, and biodiversity loss is that they act in a similar way to how the Covid-19 pandemic spreads, all be it at a much slower pace. Infections may be occurring at any given moment, but it&#8217;s only weeks later that we find out the true impact of an outbreak. Similarly, the damage dealt to the environment now will have serious repercussions on the future state of the planet.</p>
            <p>So there is hope left, because it will never be too late for mankind. At least a small community will survive no matter what we do, that&#8217;s almost certain. We just need to decide whether to act now to save as much as we possibly can of the natural world and the human population – or if we want to keep procrastinating in the hope that a miraculous innovation will save us. The latter sounds easier, but it&#8217;s important to understand that every day we don&#8217;t act, the death toll adds up. And we&#8217;ll die in the same order we always have in history when faced with crises: the poor first and the rich last.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this is the opposite order of responsibility for the current environmental crisis, since the highest-impact individuals are usually the wealthiest.</p>
            <h5><strong>Can We Do It?</strong></h5>
            <p>If the Covid-19 pandemic has shown anything, it&#8217;s that governments are willing to sacrifice their economies for the welfare of their population – even if some of that population may not agree. In times of crisis, countries seem to be able to mobilize incredible amounts of money in a relatively short amount of time [the pandemic has also helped some of us realize how much we rely on nature to maintain good health, and that staying inside all day isn&#8217;t the kind of future we want to force on future generations].</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s extremely encouraging for the climate and biodiversity crises. We&#8217;d even expect green solutions to receive much more support than Covid-19 relief programs, since environmental action doesn&#8217;t require countries to sacrifice their economies entirely. It certainly means budgets will have to be restructured, but shaping a sustainable future isn&#8217;t a charitable act – it&#8217;s an investment. </p>
            <p>On top of the various economic incentives of integrating eco-friendly solutions, there are plenty of other reasons to develop more sustainable societies – like increasing food and water security, providing stable blue-collar employment, and improving urban air quality. Increased sharing of our resources will also help lower-income individuals improve their quality of life without impacting the higher-income earners too much. At the international scale, sharing could help reduce conflicts over essential resources and decrease the number of environmental refugees that will otherwise flood borders in the next few decades. </p>
            <p>So yes, we can do it. But if we don&#8217;t hit the brakes now, we&#8217;ll crash even harder.</p>`

That is, with our current methods of dealing with urban population increases.</p>
                <p>The Earth has a limited amount of land, but we need more space for food production and urban expansion. To make room for these, we’ve been destroying ecosystems. Currently, we’re expanding our cities much faster than urban population is increasing, indicating that we’re building large houses along the city limits instead of preparing for future population growth with smaller units.</p>
                <p>It’s not just about future population growth. In 2020, an estimated 1.6 billion people lived in inadequate housing conditions, equivalent to over 20% of the global population the same year.</p>

                <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html">55</a>% of the world&#8217;s population lived in urban areas. This is projected to increase to <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html">68</a>% by 2050. A scary thought for those who live in already extremely dense cities. However, if we can expand our cities the right way, in the right direction, then we&#8217;ll all fit just fine – while increasing energy efficiency and reducing biodiversity loss.</p>
                <p>Worldwide, urban land expansion is happening at a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6669/pdf">faster</a> rate than urban population growth rates. This shows that as we move further away from city centers, we start building larger houses and neighborhoods instead of apartments and condos. This corroborates the idea that someone living downtown is likely taking up less room than others who live near the city limits [some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158103/">studies</a> have attempted to quantify this &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and have found that urban area growth rate is over twice the urban population growth rate].</p>
                <h5 id="agriculture-and-energy-delivery"><strong>Agriculture and Energy Delivery</strong> </h5>
                <p>In 2019, agriculture [i.e. crop and livestock farming] occupied roughly <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">50</a>% of the Earth&#8217;s habitable land area. As food production <a href="https://encyclopedia2.com/food/">booms</a>, this percentage is bound to increase if we continue with our unsustainable food systems. The main problem with agricultural expansion is that it directly competes with areas that are already populated [e.g. green ecosystems, cities, etc&#8230;]. And since food production is an immediate necessity, it usually takes precedence over the preservation of our environment. It&#8217;s estimated that agriculture was responsible for around <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/online/ca8642en.html#chapter-5_1">73</a>% of tropical deforestation worldwide from 2000-2010 [with tropical deforestation accounting for roughly <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation">95</a>% of total deforestation].</p>
                <p>Energy delivery is another necessity that can compete with populations for land area, as pipelines are being built across ecosystems and local communities – like the 670 km Coastal GasLink pipeline in Western Canada that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51452217">sparked</a> protests across the nation.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, land use conversion of our green ecosystems releases billions of tonnes of GHGs into the atmosphere every year – and induces significant biodiversity loss through habitat loss.</p>
                <h5 id="human-land-space"><strong>Human Land Space</strong></h5>
                <p>Humans don&#8217;t take up that much space for housing and infrastructure compared to agriculture. Even with almost <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/population-and-education/">8</a> billion people on Earth in 2021 [projected to peak at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620306772">9.73</a> billion by 2064], only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">1</a>% of habitable land is considered &#8220;urban and built-up&#8221;. Regardless, we need shelter to live in humane conditions. And if the global population is expected to grow by close to 2 billion people in less than 30 years, we&#8217;re going to have to expand our cities.</p>
                <p>But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves. We&#8217;re already unable to secure good living conditions for the world&#8217;s current population. In 2020, an estimated <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/2020/03/resolution-homelessness/">1.6</a> billion people lived in inadequate housing conditions [adequate includes a minimum of the following <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/housing/toolkit/pages/righttoadequatehousingtoolkit.aspx">elements</a>: legal security of tenure, affordability, habitability,  accessibility, proximity to services, availability of infrastructure, and cultural adequacy]. That was equivalent to over 20% of the global population at the time.</p>
                <p>In addition, a 2005 U.N. report established that approximately <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G05/117/55/PDF/G0511755.pdf?OpenElement">100</a> million people were homeless. This has surely <a href="https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/cities-grow-so-do-numbers-homeless">increased</a> since, <a href="https://undocs.org/A/75/148">especially</a> with the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
                <p>Combining the problems listed above with the fact that middle classes of highly populated developing countries continue to get richer, the demand for more space keeps increasing [since higher income almost always leads to more spacious housing]. The most widespread solution so far has been urban expansion.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are 2 major problems with this:</p>
                <ul type="1"><li>As cities expand, the new homes will need to be connected to the rest of the world with water and gas pipes, roads, electricity, and more. The infrastructure required to expand our cities requires loads of money, materials, and energy. The longer commutes to CBDs [central business districts –where most people work or go for leisure] would also increase GHG and toxic emissions from transportation.</li><li>If our cities expand, then they&#8217;re expanding into a previously occupied area. Most of the time, that ends up being forests, grasslands, or other green ecosystems. These &#8216;expendables&#8217; that surround our cities will continue to be chopped down as cities grow, as they have been in the past. Urban expansion caused roughly <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/online/ca8642en.html#chapter-5_1">10</a>% of tropical deforestation from 2000-2010.</li></ul>
                <h5 id="slowing-urban-expansion"><strong>Slowing Urban Expansion</strong></h5>
                <p>To avoid spreading into green ecosystems and depleting resources, we&#8217;ll need to adopt more efficient housing strategies. We&#8217;ve got some examples in the solutions, but we&#8217;ll go over the most important large-scale solutions here.</p>
                <p>As a no-brainer, we&#8217;ll need to discourage people from owning [and not renting] multiple homes. Especially those located in urban areas – remote cottages are a bit different. To do so, we&#8217;ll have to change the current notion that wasting valuable land [i.e. owning secondary urban homes] is a sign of success. In truth, it&#8217;s extremely concerning that individuals are allowed to play Monopoly while homeless people roam the streets. Stronger policies and regulations can help dissuade anyone from owning more than one home in urban areas.</p>
                <p>On top of that, owning a vacant second home roughly doubles our land use footprint, which has consequences in urban areas. Since these homes are off the market, a trickle-down effect [e.g. wealthy individuals can&#8217;t buy a home in the city center, so they might settle for a home near the city&#8217;s periphery, and so on] eventually forces less fortunate individuals to move away from the city center to find an affordable home – contributing to urban expansion. </p>
                <p>In the same boat as making sure all homes are occupied, we have its square footage. Evidently, if a large house is built on twice the area of a standard house, then from a pure land use perspective – the effects are essentially the same as owning a second house. This is why apartment buildings are fantastic as far as land use efficiency. Building higher, as opposed to larger, means our individual land use footprint would be incredibly small.</p>
                <p>For example, imagine a tall apartment building that can accommodate over 200 families, while only occupying the land area of 4 standard houses. In this scenario, each apartment ends up occupying just 2% of the area of 1 standard house. That&#8217;s a lot less than the 200-house alternative. And to compensate for the lack of backyards, we could easily have large green areas like parks and gardens nearby. All we have to do is expand higher instead of spreading.</p>
                <p>More urban green areas would also be extremely helpful for air/noise pollution control and water management. Vegetation and soil can absorb pollutants and reduce precipitation runoff during storms to help large cities save <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380017300960">hundreds</a> of millions of USD every year. The more green spaces there are, the more a city can save.</p>
                <p>Additionally, if we lived closer to one another in apartment buildings, we&#8217;d be reducing the amount of resources we consume in our day-to-day lives. Examples feature lower gasoline consumption due to smaller commutes [and increased public transit use], less pressurization required for natural gas and water transport, and less electricity losses. Without forgetting the enormous quantities of metal, asphalt, and concrete we can save by not extending roads, water mains, gas pipes, and electricity transmission networks. We&#8217;ll also be able to share more, which will reduce our material consumption. For example, apartment buildings can have shared laundry machines, game consoles, pools, and even cars [e.g. with a simple online booking system].</p>
                <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
                <p>Decreasing our individual living area is necessary, as ecosystems around the world are suffering from land use conversion. As our population and individual demands grow, we will be faced with a choice. We can keep expanding into our environment and depleting natural resources while losing energy efficiency, or we can show restraint and change our way of thinking about housing. Building higher will lead us to lower individual land use and carbon footprints. It will also free up more space for nature to grow in urban areas, allowing more sustainable agriculture to take place locally. All the while avoiding further land use conversion. Everyone stands to benefit from more green spaces in urban areas, even city budgets.</p>`

                <ul><li><strong>Live in an apartment.</strong> It&#8217;s never too late to make the switch, and this can help you share a small patch of land with hundreds of others. </li><li><strong>Split your house into multiple apartments.</strong> This can help you make some extra money while considerably reducing your land use.</li><li><strong>Alternatively, get roommates. </strong>This is another effective way of reducing your land use.</li><li><strong>Make the most out of your backyard.</strong> Grow a garden or just let nature do its thing. Cutting the grass weekly or having concrete laid overtop the soil both waste significant amounts of space – as far as the environment is concerned.</li><li><strong>Work remotely if you can.</strong> If possible, show your company you&#8217;d prefer working at home. This will help your company downsize their buildings, where the freed-up space could be converted into apartments.</li><li><strong>Sell or rent your second house.</strong> Especially if it&#8217;s in an urban area. Short term renting while you&#8217;re away is a decent start – but selling or renting long term will allow people to settle in for a while, which reduces the need for urban expansion.</li></ul>
                <p><em>Note that owning land in the middle of nowhere isn&#8217;t always an issue, depending on what you make of it. Having a second house in a natural environment to plant trees, crops, and restore any previous damage is a fantastic way to chip in and offset your environmental impacts. However, if the plan is to build a house near the city limits and flip it for profit when city limits reach your land, then that just sounds like premature urban expansion.</em></p>

                <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Enforce or encourage working from home.</strong> Companies that encourage their employees to work from home can help reduce commuter emissions, while downsizing into smaller offices. In fact, companies can save big on rent if they move into smaller buildings – or if they simply rent out the vacant floors to other businesses.</li><li><strong><em>Governments &amp; Businesses: </em>Free up urban space to design tall apartment buildings. </strong>Constructing loads of apartment buildings would be especially useful downtown, where people have access to a lot of shared amenities. This should also help lower the cost of living downtown. In any case, densification will surely reduce the need for urban expansion.</li><li><strong><em><strong><em>Businesses &amp; Governments: </em></strong></em>Take advantage of &#8216;free space&#8217; to avoid further land use conversion.</strong> For example, electricity grids can install their solar panels on available rooftops in the city. This can help reduce losses, improve grid reliability, and avoid having to build land-consuming solar farms.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Ban deforestation near city limits and/or make land use conversion expensive.</strong> Increasing the environment&#8217;s value can help incur additional costs to land developers that are looking to expand cities – which can help guide them toward densification instead.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Increase the number of green spaces in cities.</strong> There&#8217;s loads of room for all kinds of green spaces in urban areas – and we could free up a lot more room with better transportation management. Green spaces improve air quality and water management systems in urban areas.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Increase taxes on individuals that own multiple homes.</strong> Especially if the homes are vacant and within city limits. This will force individuals to share the Earth instead of playing Monopoly with people&#8217;s livelihoods.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Lower taxes even further for people who live in apartments.</strong> Either the occupant isn&#8217;t very wealthy and lives in an apartment, in which case lower taxes are well received – or the occupant is wealthy but chooses to live in a smaller home, in which case lower taxes are a reward for an eco-friendly decision.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Subsidize house-to-apartment renovations.</strong> This will incentivize house owners to reduce their land use. These renovations would also be a great time for them to beef up their house&#8217;s insulation materials to reduce their footprint even further.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Impose a higher tax on lone house occupants.</strong> Taxes would vary based on your individual land use footprint. Getting a few roommates would be an easy way to avoid this tax.</li><li><strong><strong><em>Governments: </em></strong>Adopt better urban transportation management. </strong>Improving public transit, banning cars in city centers, and getting rid of parking areas are just a few of the many solutions that can help free up space downtown, all the while reducing the transportation sector&#8217;s impacts. As mentioned previously, this would also improve air quality in dense cities. </li></ul>`
