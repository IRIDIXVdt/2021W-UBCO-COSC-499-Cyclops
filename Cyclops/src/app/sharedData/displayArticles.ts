                segmentTitle:"Climate Change",
                segmentBody:`<p>Climate change is not something that occurs overnight.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere consists of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon – and just <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">0.04</a>% carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>]. In this section, we&#8217;ll see how this ridiculously small percentage of CO<sub>2</sub>, along with other greenhouse gases [GHGs] in the atmosphere, can have remarkable consequences at the global scale.</p>
                <h5 id="the-earth-s-energy-balance">The Earth&#8217;s Energy Balance</h5>
                <p><em>For the following section, think of radiation as energy or heat contained in a ray of light.</em></p>
                <p>The Sun emits light as shortwave radiation. The Earth heats as it absorbs some of that radiation, before sending a portion of that back towards space as longwave radiation. Unfortunately, the longwave type of radiation can be absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. These gases then re-emit this energy in all directions. Here&#8217;s the issue: the energy that was supposed to be sent back to space is now partially redirected towards the Earth&#8217;s surface – which effectively traps heat in our atmosphere.</p>
                <p>What we&#8217;ve just explained here is the famous greenhouse effect, where heat is trapped in our atmosphere by the likes of CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs. This effect has been taking place since our atmosphere formed billions of years ago and has played an important role in keeping the Earth warm, but now it&#8217;s making it a tad too hot – way too fast. We&#8217;ve recently released GHGs in the atmosphere in such quantities that the previously stable energy balance is now tilted in favor of heating the Earth.</p>
                <h5 id="global-warming-and-climate-change"><strong>Global Warming and Climate Change</strong></h5>
                <p>By now, we hope you&#8217;ve guessed the consequence of the greenhouse effect: global warming. All the additional heat trapped in our atmosphere has been increasing our average global temperature. In fact, during the 2011-2020 period, global surface temperatures had increased by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">1.09</a>°C compared to the 1850-1900 period. This shows once again that global warming is real and it began well over a century ago.  </p>
                <p><strong>GHGs</strong></p>
                <p>Scientific consensus is <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">very clear</a> that the atmosphere&#8217;s GHG content has been increasing rapidly because of human activity. Since 1750, atmospheric concentrations have risen by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">47</a>% for CO<sub>2</sub>, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">156</a>% for methane [CH<sub>4</sub>], and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">23</a>% for nitrous oxide [N<sub>2</sub>O]. In 2019, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were higher than at any point in the past <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">2</a> million years, and we&#8217;ve emitted more CO<sub>2</sub> since. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are far more GHGs than just CO<sub>2</sub> – and much more powerful ones too. For equal emissions [by mass], CO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">28</a> times less greenhousy than methane and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/quantification-guidance/global-warming-potentials.html">22,800</a> times less greenhousy than sulfur hexafluoride [&#8216;greenhousy&#8217; describes the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">global warming potential</a> of a gas – here, taken over 100 years]. However, we&#8217;ve been producing so much more CO<sub>2</sub> in the past few centuries that it&#8217;s still the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">largest</a> contributor to global warming, with methane not too far behind. </p>
                <p><strong>From Global Warming to Climate Change</strong></p>
                <p>The Earth&#8217;s atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are 2 major reasons that our climates are the way they are. They play extremely critical roles in the global water and carbon cycles, dictate precipitation patterns, and help shape many of the world&#8217;s oceanic current systems. Unfortunately, that means that any slight variations in temperature can have devastating consequences at the global scale – notably by changing many climates at once. </p>
                <p>Climate change literally means changes in climate patterns and events. Cyclones, storm surges, heat waves, droughts, and extreme precipitations are all destructive climate events that are occurring more frequently and/or more intensely as a result of global warming. </p>
                <p>For example, global warming increases the atmosphere&#8217;s capacity to hold water vapor. In turn, this can cause more/bigger clouds to form, which can lead to more intense precipitation events [potentially causing floods]. This corroborates the projection that extreme daily precipitation events will intensify by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">7</a>% for every +1°C of global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]. That may not sound significant, but we have to keep in mind that long-term global temperatures are projected to reach +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">3.3-5.7</a>°C under the &#8220;very high GHG emissions scenario&#8221;. So all the 7% intensifications can add up real fast if emissions aren&#8217;t curbed soon. </p>
                <p>Alas it&#8217;s even worse than that. Global warming and climate change are driving many long-term &#8216;irreversible&#8217; effects that will have significant consequences worldwide. In particular, the IPCC has outlined the following points:</p>
                <ul><li>Mountain and polar glaciers are projected to continue <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> for decades or centuries. Even if we were to drastically reduce our emissions in the coming decades [to limit warming to +<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.5</span></a>°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century], the Arctic would still be likely to experience <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">at least one</span></a> sea ice free summer before 2050. And unsurprisingly, uncontrolled emissions in the near future would lead to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">far more occurrences</span></a> of sea ice free summers in the Arctic.</li><li>GHGs contained in permafrost [i.e. grounds that are completely frozen] will irreversibly be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">released</span></a> into the atmosphere during permafrost thaw, at centennial timescales. Preventing permafrost thaw as much as possible by reducing our emissions will be key to reduce the amount of GHGs released by the environment. Otherwise, reaching the &#8216;tipping point&#8217; for permafrost will induce more global warming, which can establish negative feedback loops [i.e. vicious circles] that end up causing even more irreversible damage.</li><li>The Greenland Ice Sheet will keep <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">melting</span></a> and the Antarctic Ice Sheet will <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">likely</span></a> do the same, although the total amount of ice loss remains to be seen. In Greenland, total ice loss will be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">heavily influenced</span></a> by the amount of GHGs we emit in the next few decades [there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of evidence that would suggest the same is true for Antarctica, for now at least].</li><li>Sea level will continue to rise for <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">hundreds to thousands</span></a> of years, after which it will maintain its elevation for additional <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">thousands of years</span></a>. Over the next 2000 years for example, the average global sea level is expected to rise by roughly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-3</span></a> meters if we limit global warming to +1.5°C, by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2-6</span></a> meters with a +2°C limit, or by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">19-22</span></a> meters at +5°C [i.e. temperature reached in 2100]. And there&#8217;s a very real <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">possibility</span></a> that sea levels continue to rise after those 2000 years have passed, especially if we keep increasing the amount of GHGs we release every year. In the short term, the average global sea level rise will likely be contained between <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">0.28-2</span></a> meters by 2100, depending on if we limit warming to +1.5°C or if we keep growing it to +5°C over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li></ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are too many consequences to global warming and climate change to list them all here. However, a few of them can help us understand how humans will be directly impacted by these changes – notably by threatening global food and water security, increasing the likeliness and intensity of extreme weather events, and forcing climate migration on <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36248">hundreds of millions</a> of individuals around the globe [among many more consequences].</p>
                <p>Sadly, many indirect effects will also drastically impact human lives, like biodiversity loss. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate Feedbacks</strong></p>
                <p>Global warming isn&#8217;t all due to GHG emissions, at least not directly. Interestingly, climate change has its own impacts on the Earth&#8217;s energy balance, known as &#8216;climate feedbacks&#8217;. We&#8217;ve seen a few examples of climate feedbacks already – between the release of permafrost GHGs, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers [which reflect radiation back toward space], and the increasing concentrations of water vapor in the atmosphere [a potent GHG]. In these examples of positive climate feedbacks, initial warming causes climate change, which itself amplifies the initial warming – which then induces additional climate change. </p>
                <h5 id="climate-vs-weather"><strong>Climate vs. Weather</strong></h5>
                <p>It&#8217;s important to note that global warming and climate change don&#8217;t imply that every day will be hotter than the last. Weather is not the same as climate. Weather describes short term events and temperatures that don&#8217;t really mean anything on their own – since weather is subject to internal and natural variability [i.e. a certain level of randomness]. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, climate is pretty much just weather averaged out over longer periods of time. As such, climate change is responsible for increasing the likeliness of extreme weather events – but can&#8217;t guarantee that they will take place at any given moment. Similarly, a single record-breaking temperature could not confirm climate change is real, nor could a freezing temperature refute it. </p>
                <p>That being said, when year after year we measure record-breaking daily, weekly, monthly, and annual temperatures [or extreme weather events] in very different parts of the world, it becomes pretty clear that global warming and climate change are already here. It&#8217;s no longer the future generation&#8217;s problem.</p>`

                segmentTitle:"Bidodiversity Loss",
                segmentBody:`<p>Biodiversity loss may not get as much attention as climate change does, but it&#8217;s just as bad. Biodiversity can be defined in a number of ways. Here, we&#8217;ll define it as the grouping of the genetic, species, and ecosystem diversities all into one. As we&#8217;ll see in this section, these 3 types of diversities are all interconnected and interdependent.</p>
                <h5>Genetic Diversity</h5>
                <p>Genetic diversity describes the total number of genetic variations that a species has in its gene pool. For an example of a genetic variation, think of the human gene that determines eye color, where variations can range from black to blue, or even light gray. Strong genetic diversity is driven by numerous different genetic variations that are &#8216;mixed&#8217; together during reproduction. With greater gene pools, the odds that 2 mating individuals will have different genetic codes is higher. Strong genetic diversity within a species is closely related to their strength and ability to survive.&nbsp; As a counterexample, think of 2 siblings that reproduce [whose genetic code is very similar], their children have a higher risk of being born with disabilities.</p>
                <p>With more diverse individuals, the species will adapt better to their ever-evolving environment, making the species stronger as a whole.</p>
                <h5>Species Diversity</h5>
                <p>Species diversity is self-explanatory. A higher number of different animals and plants leads to greater species diversity. One easy way to show the importance of species diversity is with the food chain. We all know at least one example of the &#8216;ladder&#8217; that features the ultimate predators [like a lion] at the top and the defenseless prey [like grass] at the bottom. Each species feeds on the ladder step below itself – but would not survive without it. </p>
                <p>Strong species diversity implies that a predator will not have to depend on a single prey. Instead, the predator will have multiple options that can satisfy its diet. This way, when the population of one of the prey species lowers, the predator will predate more on the other sources of food due to the prey&#8217;s rareness [not a conscious choice, just statistical]. Contrarily, if a prey species threatens to become invasive due to an increase in population size, predators are more likely to feed on it. This provides balance within the ecosystem as it regulates and limits each species&#8217; demography – ensuring that resources aren&#8217;t over-exploited by a single species. A balanced and diverse ecosystem is a strong ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Where a weak ecosystem&#8217;s food chain is dependent on each ladder step, a strong ecosystem can be visualized as multiple ladders side-by-side. If a ladder step is weakened, you can always rely on the other steps next to it.</p>
                <h5>Ecosystem Diversity</h5>
                <p>Ecosystem diversity is extremely important as well and its effects are easier to visualize than for the previous two.</p>
                <p>An ecosystem is a natural environment in which plants, animals, and their surroundings coexist in balance. Many different ecosystems exist around the world, and they all help regulate the Earth. Jungles, deserts, glaciers, savannahs, reefs, prairies, oceans, and many more all have unique characteristics that literally make the world a better place. Jungles and forests for example, play an essential role in the water and carbon cycles. Deserts and glaciers may seem like uninhabitable wastes of space, but they help regulate the Earth&#8217;s temperature with their reflectiveness. Oceans don&#8217;t reflect much, but they do help mitigate global warming by absorbing a <a href="https://href.li/?https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">quarter</a> of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every year.</p>
                <p>Maintaining our diverse ecosystems around the globe is essential if we are to preserve our remaining natural environments and the life they contain, improve yields, limit global warming, mitigate the effects of climate change, and more. If it had to be summed up in a single sentence: biodiversity helps improve/preserve anything that involves the natural world – which we depend on heavily. </p>
                <h5><strong>Threats</strong></h5>
                <p>Biodiversity is beautiful and balanced – but fragile. 5 major causes of biodiversity loss are a direct result of human activity, following the acronym <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">H.I.C.O.P.</a>:</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat loss</strong> describes the physical deterioration or &#8216;shrinking&#8217; of a species&#8217; environment. Affected species are seeing huge declines in their population size, and many are forced to migrate quickly into other ecosystems all at once, significantly unbalancing it. This can cause invasive species.</p>
                <p><strong>Invasive species</strong> are characterized as such when a single species starts dominating an ecosystem. This considerably weakens ecosystems as it does not allow species diversity or balance. They are especially a problem when foreign species integrate a new environment and start outcompeting native species, as the native species are often crucial for ensuring ecosystem balance. Invasive species can occur naturally, but are often a consequence of human activity because of a rapid change in their environment. </p>
                <p><strong>Climate change</strong> describes the change in the climate due to human activity. Since you&#8217;ve made it this far, we&#8217;re going to assume you know what we&#8217;re talking about. Climate change can seriously affect biodiversity, as it threatens species that depend on a stable climate pattern. The list of such species isn&#8217;t limited to polar bears and penguins – species all around the world have adapted to a very specific climate. An abrupt change in the climate [like the one we&#8217;re seeing now] severely endangers all species as they do not have time to adapt to different living conditions in such a short amount of time.</p>
                <p><strong>Overharvesting</strong> describes the excessive and destructive tendency we have to hunt species faster than they can procreate, or grow crops faster than soil can heal. It takes no expert to see that this leads to extinction of animal species and degradation of croplands. This human characteristic isn&#8217;t new or unheard of. With examples ranging from the wooly mammoth to the dodo bird, humans haven&#8217;t always shown their long-term thinking capabilities. As species go extinct and soil fertility drops, biodiversity levels decrease and entire ecosystems weaken.</p>
                <p><strong>Pollution</strong> describes the contamination of any environment that results in nature degradation. Air, water, soil, and noise. These don&#8217;t describe <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">The Last Airbender</a>&#8216;s 4 nations, these are all serious types of pollution. Toxicity present in the first 3 elements directly endangers species – especially those that live near sources of pollution. Often overlooked, noise pollution also impacts nearby species, since some of them rely on their hearing for survival and mating calls. It&#8217;s not just near cities either. Pollution can occur in remote parts of the world where biodiversity is strong, as shown by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Pollution significantly weakens ecosystems as both its species and their environment are damaged simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>`

            segmentTitle:"",
            segmentBody:`<p>Changing the way we interact with nature is essential to avoid further climate change and biodiversity loss – but there&#8217;s more to it than that. Transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones helps secure a stable future, by ensuring that everything we do, we can do forever. </p>
            <h5><strong>Infinite Growth in a Finite World</strong></h5>
            <p>We live in economies that require growth for our societies to function. As the backbone of our economies, companies are drivers of growth. A successful company will expand and hire more employees, leading to growth in the society. The quest for growth is the main reason that companies are always innovating and integrating new markets. If they don&#8217;t and instead stay stagnant with their current products and customers, another company with newer products will leave them in the dust [similarly, financial growth requires that &#8220;your money should be making more money&#8221; with investments – another continuous increase]. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, maintaining growth isn&#8217;t an easy task. And doing so forever in a finite world constrained by limited resources– well that&#8217;s simply impossible. We&#8217;ll touch more on that later.</p>
            <h5><strong>Resources and Innovation </strong></h5>
            <p>Thinking about our surrounding objects in terms of how many resources they&#8217;ve consumed can change the way you see the world. The new smartwatch launched today sure looks small, but its components have a massive footprint. Those mahogany kitchen cabinets? Same thing. Unless you live in the woods butt naked, everything around you has had a negative impact on the environment.</p>
            <p>Innovating at the expense of the environment is understandable when it means lifting populations out of poverty and increasing quality of life. However, nowadays most innovations don&#8217;t help people make ends meet. Instead, they target people who already have enough, with newer [and often useless] products that help them accomplish tasks a fraction of a second faster, or automatically. Must we really deplete more of the world&#8217;s resources to avoid something as simple as flipping a light switch?</p>
            <p>Although innovation has and will continue to lead to fantastic advances where it matters, like medical brain-scanning devices or vaccines, we have to remember that everything has a cost. As we try to reduce our global impacts on the environment, it&#8217;ll be our responsibility to determine which inventions are worth extracting/polluting for – and which ones are just profit-seeking wastes of resources. </p>
            <h5><strong>Adapting to a Declining Economy in a Sustainable Future</strong></h5>
            <p>As we&#8217;ve stated a few times, our economies are built on growth. Unfortunately, developed countries are just that – developed. Modern economic growth relies on infinite resources and population, but that&#8217;s obviously not realistic. We can&#8217;t open more markets once we&#8217;ve already achieved full globalization, and combining that with limited resources and declining population growth, we get a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG">declining</a> GDP growth rate [gross domestic product &#8211; more on that below] – which will eventually result in a declining GDP [once the growth rate reaches the negatives]. That sounds bad, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Not all economic systems have to depend on growth.</p>
            <p>With a good transition plan in place, we&#8217;ll be just fine. Given the time, we can surely develop more sustainable employment opportunities for everyone, no matter the level of education. For example, in the future – we&#8217;ll need more factory workers to make insulator material, engineers to design better water management systems, and coders to develop tools to evaluate energy efficiency [and much more]. So there&#8217;s room for everyone.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s without the transition plan that it gets a bit trickier. We won&#8217;t attempt to predict the future here, but we&#8217;ll note a few important things:</p>
            <ol><li>Our planet&#8217;s resources are finite, which means that businesses that rely on the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources will fail in the long term [in other words, if we can&#8217;t do something forever, then at some point we&#8217;ll have to stop]. There&#8217;s no getting around that. </li><li>Governments that are unprepared will – by definition – not be ready to change. Unfortunately, creating the right conditions for a sustainable transition takes time. Consequently, if we wait and don&#8217;t come up with a plan soon, we&#8217;re effectively telling workers in unsustainable industries that their eventual unemployment [see 1.] doesn&#8217;t matter.</li><li>When large chunks of the population are unemployed at the same time [see 1.], shit happens. If history repeats itself, then that either takes the form of direct violence, political extremism, or clashes between different ethnic groups. </li></ol>
            <p>So it&#8217;d be best if we started the transition to a more sustainable society sooner rather than later. On top of just being the logical thing to do based on the arguments presented above, it would also help us reduce our impacts on the environment before it&#8217;s too late. </p>
            <h5><strong>What now</strong></h5>
            <p>Where should we focus our efforts to reduce our impacts on the planet as efficiently as possible? For many individuals trying to get more familiar with the environmental crisis and its solutions, this is the million-dollar question. In essence, it amounts to asking: who&#8217;s responsible for the situation we&#8217;re in, and what can the culprits do differently? </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, neither individuals, companies, nor governments can be blamed for 100% of the global warming or biodiversity loss that has occurred to date. That&#8217;s too bad – it could have made our job of fixing this mess a whole lot easier. Instead, it&#8217;s pretty clear that all 3 parties contributed in their own ways to the progressive release of GHG emissions and destruction of natural habitats. </p>
            <p>Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that certain companies and governments are off the hook for purposefully slowing down environmental action and interfering with the scientific community – something that&#8217;s still very common today. It simply means that individuals have also had a negative impact on the planet, and it&#8217;s important to understand that. </p>
            <p>However, it&#8217;s hard to say whether that means individuals share some of the responsibility of where we&#8217;re at with the environment today. For the longest time, nobody had a clue that there was a problem. And when many of us recently realized that there was, climate change and biodiversity loss had already become systemic issues, deeply engrained in our societies. </p>
            <p>As such, to mitigate both climate change and biodiversity loss, solutions first and foremost have to come from governments and companies to affect change at large scales. For individuals, there are personalized solutions that can help us reduce our impacts on the environment – and we&#8217;ll see plenty in later sections – but it&#8217;s important to note that our efforts would be much more useful if aimed toward uprooting the unsustainable practices that our current systems rely on. </p>
            <p>At the same time, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that some of our habits are purely unsustainable – no matter how careful we are. In those instances, truly eco-friendly [as opposed to people-pleasing] governments will have to pass strong regulations to ensure those habits change, for the better of the planet. Unfortunately, there can be significant pushback on these types of policies, as the individual liberty of having unsustainable habits is lost. </p>
            <p>People-pleasing governments that don&#8217;t pass such policies, on the other hand, end up taking far less risks. And as the term &#8216;people-pleasing&#8217; indicates, they&#8217;ll likely have better odds of reelection. That&#8217;s not something politicians can ignore. Sadly though, they&#8217;ll achieve far less meaningful change this way  – which simply isn&#8217;t an option with the crisis at hand. </p>
            <p>As such, to answer the question asked above: the most important thing individuals can do is voice their support for policies, to let governments know that they&#8217;ll be okay with the consequences. CyclopediApp&#8217;s next version will provide a plethora of resources for individuals to easily influence large scale decision-making.</p>
            <h5>Where to Start</h5>
            <p>To prevent unemployment and population unrest, governments have to step up and put more emphasis on the performance indicators that matter. The GDP is an outdated metric that doesn&#8217;t track what actually affects populations and fails to capture the environmental losses resulting from pollution and extraction. </p>
            <p>As such, governments should &#8220;<a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">stop directing our economic system to the search for maximum growth and to constant increase in the gross national product.</a>&#8221; Instead, they&#8217;d be better off evaluating <a href="https://themansholtletter.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/sites/default/files/brief_mansholt_malfatti_en1.pdf">happiness</a>, education rates, natural stability, and of course employment rates [e.g. <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">HDI</a>, WDI, PQLI, etc&#8230;]. <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/making-peace-nature">Switching</a> from the GDP to these metrics will help our societies track stability and sustainability – which will help us focus our efforts there. </p>
            <p>As we go along and point out weaknesses in the current economic system, it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t suggest throwing the entire capitalist system in the trash. However, it&#8217;s also essential to realize that capitalism relies on certain unrealistic assumptions for it to &#8216;work&#8217;, like the quest for infinite growth we&#8217;ve mentioned a few times already. Capitalism was defined with a set of rules several centuries ago, so we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of tweaking things that clearly aren&#8217;t possible as we go. It would be mighty unfair of us to expect that the early developers of capitalism could predict the future and the environmental crisis. After all, capitalism prides itself on innovation – it only seems fair to invent new rules for the system itself.</p>
            <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Adapting to a more sustainable economic model will be essential. Not only because the current unsustainable model can&#8217;t go on forever, but also because it&#8217;s an opportunity to drastically reduce unemployment, conflicts, and the destruction of our natural systems around the world.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we&#8217;ll have to voice our support for policies that can affect change at the larger scales – while being ready to adapt to more sustainable lifestyles. CyclopediApp will help with that.</p>`

            segmentBody:`<p>Fossil fuels are non-renewable, polluting energy sources that we burn daily to power the world. Cities are no strangers to such pollution, as there are over 1 billion cars on the road that burn fossil fuels every day and decrease urban air quality. Biodiversity is also affected by the air, water, and soil pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. It&#8217;s extremely important that we prevent such contamination, since what harms the environment directly threatens humans.</p>
            <p>Fossil fuels are dominating the global energy and electricity mixes – and it seems as though that will remain the case in the near future. Although a few local electricity mixes are practically fossil-fuel-free, they usually aren&#8217;t examples that the rest of the world can follow. Additionally, electricity only represents around a fifth of energy consumption worldwide, so we can&#8217;t just focus on electricity mixes if we intend on significantly reducing our emissions.</p>
            <p>Different sources of energy are used by the different sectors of our societies. We&#8217;ll see that in detail in later sections. </p>`

We&#8217;ll go over numerous examples in the main sections – but for now, just remember that it&#8217;s not only about how we produce energy – it&#8217;s also about what we use it for. </em></p>
            <h5 id="energy"><strong>Energy</strong></h5>
            <p>Everything needs energy. We need energy to get up on a Monday morning. Plants need energy to grow. Even our tectonic plates need energy to move. These are all intangibles, we will always need food, plants will always need sunlight, and the plates will keep moving as long as the Earth&#8217;s core remains a radioactive heat ball. </p>
            <p>If we look around, we&#8217;ll notice other things like our electronics, ovens, light bulbs, beds, or walls. These are all things that needed energy to be manufactured, and some still require a continuous flow of energy during use, like TVs. Since we produce and use so many material objects every day, it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that energy production is a major issue worldwide.  </p>
            <h5 id="fossil-fuels">Fossil Fuels</h5>
            <p>Fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas that are burned daily to produce energy. We burn these specific fuels because they have high energy densities, meaning that we can extract a large amount of energy in a small amount of fuel. Combusting them releases that energy as heat, which we harness in different ways depending on the application.</p>
            <p>When fossil fuels are burned, CO<sub>2</sub> is produced in large amounts. As we&#8217;ve seen, continuously producing this much CO<sub>2</sub> leads to global warming and climate change. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Fossil fuels can also emit other polluting gases, like NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>x</sub> gases, fine particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, or even mercury. These pollutants then contaminate the surrounding environment, although good pollution control processes can make sure the most harmful pollutants are treated. And while some fossil fuels emit less than others once burned, the bottom line remains that they all pollute too much.</p>
            <h5 id="largest-fossil-fuel-burners"><strong>Largest Fossil Fuel Burners</strong></h5>
            <p>There are over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/">1</a> billion miniaturized-fossil-fuel-burning machines on the road every day. Additionally, electricity production at power plants often relies on fossil fuels [as we&#8217;ll see below]. Lastly, industries aren&#8217;t limited to a supply of electricity from power plants, so many of them choose to burn fossil fuels on-site instead. That means there are loads of industrial-sized factories powered by their own fossil-fueled power plants. Between vehicles, the grid&#8217;s power plants, and industry– we continue to burn fossil fuels at an incredible rate.</p>
            <p>While pollution control regulations are in place in developed countries, other regions of the world aren&#8217;t so lucky. And although developed countries have gotten quite good at controlling toxic emissions, we don&#8217;t have many pollution control solutions in place for CO<sub>2</sub>. In fact, it&#8217;s sometimes the product of a control process [e.g. methane flaring]. Automobiles also don&#8217;t have sufficient pollution control. These little machines zoom around town, polluting densely populated areas from within.</p>
            <p>Biodiversity is being significantly damaged because of fossil fuel combustion as well. Even though we can&#8217;t notice most of them, toxic pollutants released during combustion are present in nearby air, water, and soil – and threaten everyone who depends on breathing, drinking, or eating to survive. These pollutants also cause acid rain, ocean acidification, and eutrophication [which we&#8217;ll see in later sections].</p>
            <p>Since we care almost exclusively about what affects us, we&#8217;ll say it again: if our biodiversity falls, so do we.</p>
            <h5 id="energy-and-electricity-mixes"><strong>Energy and Electricity Mixes</strong></h5>
            <p>An &#8216;energy mix&#8217; describes the mix of different energy sources used by a given organization/region. All energy sources hold a specific percentage of the total mix which represents the share of energy produced by the fuel. All sources should add up to 100%. These days, there&#8217;s lots of talk about the newest renewable energy projects and how they&#8217;re pushing fossil fuels out of our energy mix. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not even close to being true at a global scale.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the &#8216;Big 3&#8217; fossil fuels accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2020">81.3</a>% of global energy production. Note that natural gas is far from being eco-friendly, as the name could suggest. It&#8217;s mostly methane [CH<sub>4</sub>], and burning it releases loads of CO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants – although it&#8217;s still less polluting than coal.</p>

            <p>It&#8217;s important to understand the difference between energy and electricity as we go along. Electricity is a form of energy, but energy doesn&#8217;t have to be electricity. For instance, energy can include the natural gas burned to heat homes, a car&#8217;s combusted gasoline, and electricity. </p>
            <p>Electricity isn&#8217;t something we extract from nature, which is why it&#8217;s considered a secondary source of energy. Worldwide, around <a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/2ee82a9c68cd84e572c9db09cc43d7ec3e3fafe7/shell-world-energy-model.pdf">18</a>% of energy is in the form of electricity. Note that &#8216;power&#8217; is often used interchangeably with &#8216;energy&#8217;, although power actually denotes the rate at which energy is generated or consumed [i.e. high-power consuming appliances aren&#8217;t high-energy consuming if they&#8217;re only plugged in for a small amount of time].</p>
            <p>To produce electricity, we can use fossil fuels, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, or many types of renewables. Since electricity is produced by a blend of sources, we can evaluate an electricity mix – which describes the share of primary sources of energy used to produce electricity. Unfortunately, the global electricity mix is also dominated by fossil fuels, although some very rare regions of the world rely almost entirely on renewables like hydropower or geothermal for electricity production [both depend on local conditions, they&#8217;re not an example that the rest of the world can easily follow].</p>
            <p>In 2019, the world&#8217;s electricity mix was dominated by the Big 3 [really just 2 though], accounting for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% of the mix. </p>

            <p>To generate electricity in large quantities, fossil fuels are burned to heat a fluid, which then turns to steam. The steam rotates a turbine, and this motion is then converted to electricity to power homes, buildings, and factories if they&#8217;re connected to the grid. Some fossil-fueled power plants find slightly different methods to rotate the turbines [e.g. using different fluids or &#8216;big car engines&#8217;], but that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t really matter since they all have roughly the same effects.</p>
            <p>The energy source used <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">varies</a> greatly depending on the sector. For example, it makes sense that the transport sector is dominated by oil. It makes sense that the residential sector is dominated by electricity and natural gas. The graph below gives us a general idea of which energy sources are used in each sector [in developed countries]. However, it doesn&#8217;t show which sectors are the most energy intensive, nor how polluting each source is. We&#8217;ll find that out in later sections.</p>

            <p>The 3 Rs are the general rules we need to follow to reduce our impacts on the environment. </p>
            <p>Reducing our resource and energy consumption is essential to mitigate further climate change and biodiversity loss. Reducing by design and improving product quality will be key for companies to reduce their impacts. For individuals, only purchasing necessities is by far the most effective way to reduce our dependence on the natural world. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we have to stop buying products completely.</p>
            <p>Reuse is key to lower production and waste, while making sure individuals can still enjoy a certain item. As such, it&#8217;s crucial for necessities to be reusable so that we can decrease our impacts on the environment. Companies have an important role to play to encourage the reuse of their products, as they have the reach to set up effective reuse programs. Reuse can be extended to include second-hand purchases on items that weren&#8217;t specifically designed to last multiple uses. As a rule of thumb, it&#8217;s typically safe to assume that reusable items are cheaper for individuals and their wallets in the long run.</p>
            <p>Recycling is without a doubt the most integrated R in our societies, but we&#8217;re not particularly good at it. Efficient recycling systems can help mitigate further resource extraction and energy consumption, but they can&#8217;t phase out the whole production stage like the first 2 Rs can. In addition, recycling has plenty of challenges to overcome before it can take a more meaningful role at the global scale, such as triage, material blends, efficiency, increasing material demand, recycling education, limited recycling cycles, and uncollected waste. </p>
            <p>We can’t reach a 100% circular economy. However, using the 3 Rs simultaneously, we can get as close as possible. On top of reducing waste, this will help us avoid unnecessary resource extraction and energy consumption.</p>
            `
            },{
            segmentTitle:"Overview",
            segmentBody:`
            <p>The 3 &#8216;R&#8217;s are the general rules we need to follow to reduce our impacts on the environment, at any scale. We&#8217;ll see in other sections that these rules are central pillars to lowering consumption across all sectors of our societies.</p>
            <h5 id="reduce"><strong>Reduce</strong></h5>
            <p>This is the most important of the 3 Rs. Reducing our energy consumption and dependence on material objects directly reduces our environmental impacts. For companies, this means producing higher quality items that can be used for longer. As we&#8217;ll see later in this section, higher quality products can encourage reuse. The first R can also mean reducing the amount of packaging needed for a specific product, or even designing the packaging in such a way that it can be reused or recycled. That&#8217;s called reducing by design.</p>
            <p>For individuals, reducing means reducing consumption, above all else. Not purchasing a product helps avoid its production, use, and disposal impacts. That is, if companies don&#8217;t wastefully overproduce by manufacturing products that go straight from the store to the landfill. Although not purchasing a product is quite effective at the individual scale, it takes considerable social movements to boycott companies and make any difference at the larger scale.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, reducing our demand will be crucial to lower our impacts. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that we have to stop purchasing products completely, as it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to stop buying smartphones, clothing, and more. That&#8217;s especially true for essential products that have significant environmental impacts, like food. </p>
            <p>To reduce our impacts when buying these types of products, we can simply aim for the most sustainable alternatives– since buying nothing isn&#8217;t always an option. And a good way to do that is by purchasing reusable products.</p>
            <h5 id="reuse"><strong>Reuse</strong></h5>
            <p>In an ideal world, we would only rely on reducing production and its impacts. However, in this one, we&#8217;ll need to reuse stuff that has already been produced and used, to avoid further production upstream. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that companies [through goodwill or government policies] can use the second R the best, since they have the reach to implement large scale reuse programs. They also have the resources to repair any of their slightly damaged products before putting them back on the market – and the authority to assure customers that the reused product is up to the company&#8217;s standards. </p>
            <p>For individuals, changing the stigma around buying used products will be important. If we&#8217;re not on board with the whole reuse concept, then there&#8217;s really no point in setting up large scale reuse programs. Luckily, numerous reuse systems have been growing in popularity in recent years [e.g. for clothing] and have shown that individuals are ready to buy used. </p>
            <p>There are essentially 2 ways for individuals to be part of reuse systems. One option is purchasing items that were designed for multiple uses. For example, a durable T-shirt that can be worn for many uses before breaking down. For the environment and your wallet, items like these are typically more expensive up-front, but are almost always cheaper in the long term.</p>
            <p>The second scenario is to reuse objects that weren&#8217;t necessarily designed for multiple uses. By reusing plastic bags we already own, or buying second-hand items like smartphones or clothing, we can effectively reduce production upstream and save a bit of cash. While it&#8217;s true that certain reused items can deteriorate and need repair from time to time, the environmental benefits resulting from their reuse almost always end up outweighing the drawbacks. Note that some exceptions exist for older products that are far more wasteful than newer ones, like very old cars, toilets, or lightbulbs.</p>
            <h5 id="recycle"><strong>Recycle</strong></h5>
            <p>We all know this one, right? Recycling is without a doubt the most integrated R in our societies. This might be because it&#8217;s the only R that doesn&#8217;t reduce the amount of stuff we buy. Reducing and reusing limits our purchases, and unsurprisingly companies aren&#8217;t big fans of that. On the other hand, recycling can increase profits for companies by avoiding&nbsp;more resource exploitation. </p>
            <p>Currently, public recycling remains unprofitable for many materials in many countries, but that can change with better waste management systems and policies.</p>
            <p>In any case, it is certain that recycling will have to play a pivotal role in transitioning our societies into more sustainable ones, since <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/5-recycling-myths-busted-plastic/#:~:text=Recycling%20steel%20and%20tin%20cans,those%20products%20from%20virgin%20materials.">recycled</a> products can be made using <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_New_Circular_Vision_for_Electronics.pdf">much less</a> energy than products made from scratch – all the while reducing waste. Additionally, as we&#8217;ve seen for metals, resource extraction creates significant local pollution and depletes finite resources – 2 things that can be avoided thanks to recycling. </p>
            <p>With that in mind, what if we could instead recycle all components, thus creating a self-sufficient loop until the end of time? A fantastic idea, but there are some inconvenient truths and a lot of progress to be made:</p>
            <ol type="1"><li>Recycling is a complicated process that involves lots of sorting. The trash separation we&#8217;re encouraged to do in our homes is only the first step of sorting. Since we can&#8217;t ensure that all individuals respect their local recycling guidelines, recycling plants require even more sorting to avoid contaminating different types of recyclables. In addition, there are loads of different types of metals, plastics, and even glass – all recycled differently and separated as to not contaminate each other. All these sorting requirements create a lot of nit-picky work, which is done by both recycling plant workers and energy-consuming machines.</li><li>Even if we were to get our triage perfect, we create many non-recyclable materials such as some metal alloys and plastics. Some of these materials can be recycled as a chunk of material [like a brick], but not while keeping all their interesting properties. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re not very good at transforming the shape or size of many of these man-made materials without altering their carefully engineered structure – or it&#8217;s far too costly to do so. We also have trouble restoring any damage caused to a material during use [e.g. batteries that &#8216;eat&#8217; themselves during use]. </li><li>Even if we were able to triage and recycle all materials, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to stop extracting resources completely. Our recycling efficiency is incredibly variable depending on the material. For example, we have a great recycling efficiency for lead – because we invested a lot in lead recycling after learning how toxic it is when dumped in the environment. Alas, most materials don&#8217;t have that high of a recycling efficiency [for now], as demonstrated by plastic waste – of which only <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/">9</a>% has ever been recycled [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/#:~:text=Of%20the%208.3%20billion%20metric,the%20natural%20environment%20as%20litter."><span style="text-decoration:underline;">EU and China have been getting better, not the US</span></a>].</li><li>A self-sufficient cycle has one fundamental law: production can&#8217;t exceed waste. Even if all the recycling problems stated above didn&#8217;t exist, we&#8217;re still in a world of increasing material demand. As our demography and quality of life standards continue to rise, our consumption continues to increase. This is another reason why recycling cannot replace the first 2 Rs, all 3 must be employed simultaneously. </li><li>Recycling guidelines vary drastically between different regions of the world. This makes it incredibly hard for individuals to figure out which recyclables are accepted by their local recycling plant, and which should be thrown out as &#8216;regular&#8217; trash. Online tools have been developed by certain regions to address this issue, but most individuals aren&#8217;t even aware that the tools exist.</li><li>We also can&#8217;t recycle everything indefinitely, as many materials will break down after a certain number of uses. The good news is that we&#8217;re evolving away from one-and-done recycling – as materials that could previously only be recycled once can now be recycled multiple times [e.g. plastics, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/5-recycling-myths-busted-plastic/#:~:text=Recycling%20steel%20and%20tin%20cans,those%20products%20from%20virgin%20materials."><span style="text-decoration:underline;">paper</span></a>, etc&#8230;].</li><li>Not everything is collected. Recycling for many products just isn&#8217;t possible or profitable. For example, it&#8217;s estimated that there are up to <a href="https://ed.ted.com/on/uGlYK7C5?theme_id=earth-school"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">70</span></a> chemical elements in an average smartphone, including hard-to-recycle metal alloys. It&#8217;s also estimated that phones and other electronics can contain up to <a href="https://ed.ted.com/on/uGlYK7C5?theme_id=earth-school"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">16 of the 17</span></a> types of rare earth metals. Although these metals are certainly valuable, they&#8217;re present in such small amounts that companies often deem them &#8216;unworthy&#8217; of collection.</li></ol>

            <p><strong>Reduce</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t buy stuff you don&#8217;t need.</strong> It&#8217;s the easiest way to reduce. Determine whether the purchase is essential.</li><li><strong>Purchase sustainable products.</strong> Since we still need to buy essentials, we&#8217;ll have to reduce our impacts by purchasing the most sustainable alternatives available [within your price range].</li><li><strong>Think ahead before going out. </strong>This can help avoid relying on last-minute items that are often single-use [e.g. bags, bottles, etc&#8230;].</li><li><strong>Avoid single-use products, except maybe toilet paper.</strong> Cloths vs. paper towels, reusable bottles vs. plastic bottles, and reusable face masks vs. disposable masks are only a few battles of the war on single-use products.</li><li><strong>Reduce your dependence on packaging.</strong> Small plastic coffee capsules aren&#8217;t the only examples of ridiculous packaging strategies.</li><li><strong>Reduce sources of waste. </strong>Without necessarily going through your trash, try to examine which products create the most waste in your life and try to find more sustainable alternatives.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Reuse</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Avoid hoarding what you don&#8217;t use.</strong> To extend a product&#8217;s lifetime and encourage reuse, sell or donate your old belongings.</li><li><strong>Purchase used products. </strong>That includes second-hand, but also third, fourth, and so on. As long as the product can serve a purpose. There are a few exceptions for old products that pollute/consume much more than new ones during use, like old cars, toilets, and lightbulbs.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Recycle</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Adopt a Bob the Builder mentality. </strong>Try to fix things or find someone that will. If it can&#8217;t be done, find a suitable recycling bin to properly dispose of the product. Throwing out a product should be last resort, especially considering all the effort made during the first 2 Rs to extend the product&#8217;s lifetime.</li><li><strong>Take advantage of good recycling systems.</strong> Not everyone is blessed with good recycling programs, so make sure to use them and try to make the recycling process easier [next point].</li><li><strong>Research general recycling tips online. </strong>If you can find your regional waste management&#8217;s website, even better [if not, find another region&#8217;s website near you]. They should have tips and factoids that will help you recycle more efficiently and increase the recycling plant&#8217;s efficiency too.</li><li><strong>Advocate for better recycling systems. </strong>If your region/building doesn&#8217;t have a good recycling system, let the people in charge know that you&#8217;d like to recycle.</li></ul>
            <h5 id="larger-scales"><strong>LARGER SCALES</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>Reduce</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Reduce by design.</strong> Producing reusable/recyclable packaging, durable products, and resource-efficient products are just a few of the many ways companies can lower their impacts while maintaining production.</li><li><strong>Businesses: Encourage low-impact mentalities by defining a new &#8216;norm&#8217;. </strong>Right now, individuals are expected to go out of their way to reduce their impacts. Companies can help turn that around by making sure that the default settings on their products are the same as the lowest impact settings [e.g. default double-sided printing]. This will ensure individuals don&#8217;t pollute due to laziness or lack of awareness of their impacts.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Impose a heavier tax on single-use products. </strong>This would require a quick study to determine which single-use products we can&#8217;t substitute to leave them out of the tax [e.g. toilet paper]. We also wouldn&#8217;t want to penalize individuals that live paycheck-to-paycheck.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Impose heavier taxes on non-essentials, lower taxes on food and other necessities. </strong>This would help reduce the number of useless purchases, without threatening hunger on less fortunate individuals.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Ban wasteful packaging. </strong>This can help avoid excessive packaging on products that don&#8217;t really need it. Most fruits and vegetables are good examples of products that simply don&#8217;t require individual plastic wrapping.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Reuse</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Extend product lifetimes.</strong> Businesses should encourage multiple uses of their products by purchasing their used products from their customers at a cheap price. Then, after a little refurbishing, the product can be sold back to the public. This would ensure reasonable quality standards are met while employing reuse cycles.</li><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Allow and facilitate the &#8216;right to repair&#8217;.</strong> Individuals and repair shops should be able to repair broken products. Refusing to provide the know-how to do so restricts our ability to reuse products and extend their lifetimes.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Recycle</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong><em>Businesses: </em>Retain responsibility for a product.</strong> Customers should be made aware whether the product can be recycled by regular recycling plants or if they should send it back to the seller. In short, it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s responsibility to ensure the product ends up reused or recycled in the best way possible.</li><li><strong style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"><em>Businesses &amp; Governments: </em>Employ/Enforce industrial symbiosis. </strong><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">If an industry wants a specific chemical, and that chemical is being thrown out by another industry, then why not try to close the loop? Governments can enforce industrial symbiosis by banning manufacturers from throwing out &#8216;valuable waste&#8217; [i.e. that can still be used].</span></li><li><strong><em>Businesses &amp; Governments:&nbsp;</em>Improve industrial waste management.&nbsp;</strong>The industrial sector has to be held responsible for the waste they let loose in the environment. Especially when they have options to reduce their production costs with good waste management, better reuse programs, and better recycling systems.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Increase the number of recycling plants and workers.</strong> These are easy investments that create loads of jobs. Increasing the number of sorting workers in each plant will immediately boost recycling efficiency.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Establish specialized recycling plants for each category.</strong> This can help maximize recycling efficiency for each material, which would increase material recovery. This would either require individuals to become much better sorters [thanks to more info on each product] or require sorting facilities to serve as middlemen.</li><li> <strong><em>Governments: </em>Stop judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree. </strong>Instead of looking at recycling facilities as potential money-makers, start treating them as the eco-friendly solutions they are. Recycling plants are meant to divert waste from landfills/incineration plants and allow material recovery – making profits should not be the first priority.</li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Incentivize recycling.</strong> Although recycling plants shouldn&#8217;t strive for profits, engaging individuals with small monetary rewards can be extremely beneficial for recycling systems [e.g. consigned beer cans]. Additionally, it will provide a little extra income to trash-pickers, who could definitely use the money. It would also reduce litter in urban areas. </li><li><strong><em>Governments: </em>Think ahead for materials that have inefficient recycling. </strong>Some materials just use too much energy to be worth recycling. On top of avoiding these materials in product design, keeping the waste aside might be a good idea if a specific material&#8217;s recycling progress experiences a breakthrough in the future.</li></ul>

            <p>HVAC systems are responsible for&nbsp;57% of residential energy consumption in most developed countries, on average. The average residential sector in the same developed countries accounts for&nbsp;20% of final energy use – so we have the means to reduce a big chunk of our energy consumption by changing our temperature control practices.</p>
            <p>Preventive temperature control is extremely important to reduce the need for reactive control. Improving insulation is one of the most important preventive temperature control measures, as it can significantly reduce HVAC energy consumption. In addition, realizing that we can live comfortably at a wide range of temperatures [e.g. 18-26°C] will help us reduce our HVAC needs. We just need to dress accordingly.</p>
            <p>When preventive control isn&#8217;t sufficient, we rely on HVAC systems. These devices allow us to quickly stabilize space temperatures, but they&#8217;re costly and energy intensive. To reduce our impacts, we&#8217;ll need to pass the right policies, use HVAC systems as little as possible, and replace old systems with more efficient ones once end of life is reached. </p>
            <p>Without any measures in place, the world will see a surge in energy consumption from such devices, especially in warmer climates where many countries are still developing. Global A/C energy demand is expected to triple by 2050.</p>
            <p>Improving preventive temperature control is paramount, as it will help reduce the need for reactive control. Decreasing HVAC energy consumption can help us lower our GHG emissions considerably, hopefully keeping us out of a climate-change-induced vicious circle.</p>

            <p>HVAC systems [Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning] are responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">57</a>% of residential energy consumption in select <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">IEA</a> developed countries, on average [excluding water heating – would add another <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">16</a>%]. Improving temperature control could easily slash household energy consumption significantly, resulting in lower emissions and lower costs. </p>
            <p>For reference, the average residential sector in the same IEA developed countries accounts for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">20</a>% of their final energy use – so we have the means to reduce a big chunk of our energy consumption. The environmental upside here is far too important to be ignored. We must adopt better solutions now and make them more affordable. </p>
            <p>Note that residential energy consumption denotes both the electricity and natural gas consumption in a home. Heating is usually sourced with natural gas, while cooling typically consumes electricity. The cleanliness of the local electricity mix can determine whether electricity emits less or more GHGs than natural gas per unit of energy consumed. </p>
            <p>There are essentially two categories of temperature control processes: preventive and reactive [we&#8217;ll see predictive/pre-emptive in the solutions]. </p>
            <h5 id="preventive-temperature-control"><strong>Preventive Temperature Control</strong></h5>
            <p>This refers to the ability of a house or building to withstand outside temperature changes. As external temperatures rise or drop for short periods of time, a house equipped with good preventive measures will see little to no variation in the internal temperature. This can significantly lower the need for reactive control.</p>
            <p>Improving a house&#8217;s insulation is extremely important, although we have to make sure we&#8217;re using sustainable insulation materials. We&#8217;ll see in the solutions that there are many other things we can do to improve our preventive temperature control as well.</p>
            <h5 id="reactive-temperature-control"><strong>Reactive Temperature Control</strong></h5>
            <p>This refers to the systems that can quickly modify space temperature, like HVAC systems, geothermal heat pumps, or solar thermal panels [the last 2 can be effective but are currently uncommon]. When a home has poor preventive control, its temperature will vary in sync with the external temperature, at which point an HVAC system usually turns on. Whether this is done automatically or with the press of a button, the problem stays the same: reactive temperature control is responsible for a massive share of our residential energy consumption. Consequently, better preventive temperature control is extremely important and is always the better investment long term.</p>
            <p>Apartment buildings, company headquarters, and houses that have multiple floors and rooms also share the need for good ventilation – otherwise different rooms would have different temperatures [although that can be an advantage if certain rooms need to be kept cool/warm]. </p>
            <p>Houses are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">large</a> heating and cooling energy consumers since they&#8217;re surrounded by a varying external temperature – so good preventive control is crucial for them. </p>
            <p>Apartment units are usually <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">much lower</a> energy consumers than houses due to smaller air spaces per capita and shared HVAC equipment, but are perfect examples of how wasteful HVAC systems can be when poor preventive control is in place. Imagine two neighbors separated by a thin, large wall. This wall has extremely low temperature insulation.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s imagine side A of the wall is kept at 18°C, while the other [side B] is maintained at 24°C. Due to crappy insulation, side A cools side B – and B heats A. How can these systems ever reach their stable final temperatures? They don&#8217;t [not for long at least], and meanwhile both the cooling from side A and the heating from side B of the apartment continuously draw considerable amounts of power [note that for houses, the other side of the wall would be outside – which partly explains why they&#8217;re such large HVAC energy consumers].</p>
            <h5 id="what-s-the-future-of-hvac-and-its-energy-consumption"><strong>What&#8217;s the Future of HVAC and Its Energy Consumption?</strong></h5>
            <p>In many developed countries, space heating energy consumption per area has <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">decreased</a> from 2000-2018. Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t mean space heating energy consumption has decreased, since there&#8217;s an increasing number of households. The major <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php">reasons</a> for this decrease in energy intensity are better insulation systems, the migration of populations from hotter/colder climates to a more temperate climate year-round, the improved efficiency of HVAC systems, and a previously high baseline [i.e. space heating energy intensity was extremely high decades ago, so lowering it slightly isn&#8217;t much of an accomplishment].</p>
            <p>On the other hand, developing countries are facing a considerable increase in power consumption. Warm countries like Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and India each had under <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">17</a>% of their households equipped with A/C systems in 2018– but have a combined population size of over <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">2 billion</a> people. As these countries develop further, the percentage of households could rise toward that of developed countries like Japan [<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">91</a>% equipped]. That helps explains why A/C energy demand has <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/cooling">tripled</a> since 1990, and why it&#8217;s projected to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">triple</a> again by 2050. Similar effects with heating could take place in colder regions of the world, but that&#8217;s less of a concern since cold countries are typically more developed and already equipped with heating systems.</p>
            <p>Buying efficient HVAC systems is an easy way to decrease our HVAC power consumption. At an individual scale, the higher cost of efficient technologies would be offset in the following years with lower energy bills. Unfortunately, high-efficiency equipment won&#8217;t help us avoid the projected spike in A/C energy demand in developing countries – since there are just so many households to equip. Nonetheless, efficient technologies can help bring the 2050 projection of A/C energy demand down from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">3</a> times the current energy demand to only <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling">1.7</a> times. </p>
            <p>Alas, it&#8217;s not always the right time to upgrade our HVAC systems. Slight efficiencies may not be worth replacing most of our current A/C units, as the life-cycle impacts from the new units need to be considered – especially at the individual scale. In that scenario, waiting for our old units to die before replacing them is likely the best thing to do.</p>
            <p>The only sustainable solution is to reduce our HVAC demand at all scales. For governments, that will mean passing policies that incentivize individuals to improve their preventive temperature control. The right policies could allow people of any income level improve their home&#8217;s insulation, for example.</p>
            <p>For individuals, that will mean changing the way we think about temperature, on top of improving preventive temperature control. Instead of just keeping temperatures at one setting year-round, we&#8217;ll need to cope with slight temperature variations in our homes [e.g. 18-26°C]. Otherwise, if we&#8217;re unable to adapt to slight weather variations, the world&#8217;s HVAC systems will continue to consume greater amounts of energy every year – which will increase our impacts on the environment. And that will worsen climate change, which will increase HVAC energy consumption during extreme climate events, and draw us into a vicious circle.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>If we take a step back to see the whole picture, this looks very similar to a single-use vs. reuse situation. We could extensively limit the need for reactive control with better preventive equipment and techniques. Not only would that help lower our energy bills, it would also help decrease residential energy demand considerably. In turn, that would lead to less resource extraction, less GHG emissions, and less biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p><strong>P.S. –Fireplaces</strong></p>
            <p>Burning wood isn&#8217;t a great alternative to fossil-fueled heating systems. We&#8217;ve already covered why in <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/renewables/">Renewables</a> when discussing energy production from biomass. </p>

            <ul><li><strong>Adapt to temperature fluctuations. </strong>Instead of setting a single temperature year-round, adapt your settings based on the season. During the summer, wearing minimal clothing helps. During winter, you can slap on a hoodie and sweatpants. Remember that it&#8217;s completely normal to be hot in the summer and cold in the winter – and that&#8217;s not necessarily a problem. Same goes for day/night fluctuations. </li><li><strong>Alternatively,  set a loose temperature range. </strong>For example, you could just keep your temperature between 16-27°C. That may sound extreme, so just evaluate what you&#8217;d like your temperature range to be.

For others who live in colder regions, opt for darker shades. This will help you use your house&#8217;s reflectiveness to your advantage.</li><li><strong>Remember that outside air has a different temperature and is free.</strong> To change your space temperature, check the weather and open/close a window if it makes sense to do so.

            <p>Transportation accounted for&nbsp;28% of global final energy demand in 2017 and roughly 23% of&nbsp;global CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions&nbsp;in 2018. Since vehicles are extremely energy intensive and polluting, the transportation sector is an innovator’s dream.</p>
            <p>Passenger transportation is responsible for around 63% of total transportation energy use, while freight transport accounts for the remaining 37%. Globalization has allowed us to travel and trade goods over great distances, but our environment is once again paying the price. </p>
            <p>Aviation, shipping, and road vehicles have all increased their emissions in recent years, while rail continues to prove it&#8217;s the cleanest motorized transportation mode out there. Unfortunately, expensive train tickets are preventing people from reducing their footprint over long and short distances alike. To reduce environmental impacts, we&#8217;ll need to reevaluate whether eco-friendly public transit methods like buses, streetcars, or rail are really something we want to discourage with expensive fares. </p>
            <p>After taking the world by storm, electric vehicles&#8217; challenges are coming to light, slowly but surely. The pursuit for longer ranges with advances in battery efficiency will continue to titillate the research world, but that should be the least of our concerns. First, the EV industry relies on loads of finite resources, especially metals required for battery manufacturing. While it&#8217;s unsure whether we&#8217;ll be able to supply the EV industry with the amounts of metal it will require over the next decades, it is certain that doing so would have adverse effects – ranging from mining impacts to the finiteness of metals. Second, electrifying our transport is great, but we need to ensure it makes sense with our electricity mixes. An EV in a region dominated by coal for electricity production risks being counterproductive.</p>
            <p>Again, prioritizing public transit to reduce the number of cars on the road is the only surefire way to decrease environmental impacts in the long term. That requires much lower fares for long distance rail and city transit. And yes, electrifying public transit will be essential, but only because it makes sense to do so at that scale. Governments and companies can reduce the global transportation sector&#8217;s impacts considerably in the near future, if the right policies and solutions are adopted now.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence will also help reduce the number of cars in the world and on the road, although this type of technology is not without impacts on the environment either. With the proper systems in place, driverless vehicles will increase carpooling and make public transit an even better option. However, driverless vehicles aren&#8217;t available yet, with no guarantee of when they&#8217;ll roll out and help streamline public transit – so we&#8217;ll have to stick to proven solutions for now.</p>
            `

            segmentTitle:"Overview",
            segmentBody:`
            <p>Transportation accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/digitalisation-and-energy">28</a>% of global final energy demand in 2017. The sector released <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-transport-2020">8.2</a> Gt [1 Gt = 1 billion tonnes = 1 trillion kg] of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2018 alone, which represents roughly 23% of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> across all sectors the same year. Transportation&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have risen by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-transport-2020">41</a>% from 2000-2018. Alas, burning fuel doesn&#8217;t just emit CO<sub>2</sub> – it also releases toxic pollutants.</p>
            <p>Its high energy consumption and pollution make the transportation sector an innovator&#8217;s dream. Between artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, huge investments are being made to make this industry more sustainable. Both these advances have the potential to lower emissions, if applied globally at the proper scale. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have the time to wait around until they do. There are many policies and solutions that governments and companies can implement to reduce the sector&#8217;s global impacts effectively, instead of placing the blame solely on individuals. That being said, individuals have lots of opportunities to reduce their personal transportation impacts. </p>
            <p>Individual car needs are often linked to urban expansion and the proportional weakening of public transport services. In other words, as we move further away from the city, a car becomes increasingly necessary. It&#8217;s also true that as a city expands, more amenities get built far from the city center. Thus, urban populations also find themselves wanting cars. Both these factors [and many more] help explain why individuals were responsible for around <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/transportation.pdf">63</a>% of total transportation energy use in 2012.</p>
            <h5 id="globalization"><strong>Globalization</strong></h5>
            <p>We often overlook the transportation required for everything that surrounds us. Freight transport [vs. passenger transport] accounted for the remaining <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/transportation.pdf">37</a>% of the transportation sector&#8217;s energy use in 2012. Freight planes, boats, trains,&nbsp;and trucks supply us with food, raw materials, and anything else we buy far from home. For equal transportation methods, greater distances imply more fuel and therefore more emissions. However, we&#8217;ll see that some methods of transport are far more efficient than others, which we must take advantage of in the future.</p>
            <p>We should note that globalization has some wonderful aspects that allow us to share items worldwide and increase quality of life in many areas of the world. However, the environmental cost is already proving too much to bear. We need to reduce our impacts on the environment by shortening the distances we [i.e. individuals, food, other products] travel while choosing more efficient transportation methods.</p>

            <h5 id="planes"><strong>Planes</strong></h5>
            <p>Planes are astounding polluters due to the type of fuel used and the long distances travelled. Interestingly, countries don&#8217;t take responsibility for the pollutants that international airliners <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation#:~:text=CO2%20emissions%20from%20domestic,for%20countries%20to%20reduce%20them.">emit</a>. Instead, international flights are bundled together in a separate category that countries don&#8217;t really need to worry about – since emissions aren&#8217;t counted in their national totals.</p>
            <p>In 2018, international and domestic flights combined emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.93</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents roughly 11% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year. To put this in perspective – those emissions have the same weight as 9.3 billion giant pandas [with 1 panda = 100 kg] being released in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Aviation&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">38</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Planes use kerosene and other lightweight jet fuels [that have high energy density] to power the engines without adding too much weight to the aircraft. Unfortunately, these fuels release more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than standard fuel – but only <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php">7</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-03/documents/stationaryemissions_3_2016.pdf">8</a>% more. This doesn&#8217;t mean jet fuel isn&#8217;t as bad as everyone makes it sound, it means that we don&#8217;t realize how polluting gasoline is. One of the most interesting areas of innovation within the aviation sector is lowering GHG emissions by opting for alternative fuels.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s much easier said than done. We use the fuels we use because they have high enough energy densities [i.e. energy per unit of mass] to allow aircrafts to fly. And although hydrogen-fueled planes have received support from governments and aviation companies due to hydrogen&#8217;s extremely high energy density and apparent eco-friendliness, these types of planes currently face numerous challenges that make them an unlikely option in the near future.</p>
            <p>The graph below shows the amount of energy required by different passenger transportation modes – per passenger for an equal travelling distance. </p>
            <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="6774" data-permalink="https://cyclopediapp.org/image-21-2/" data-orig-file="https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png" data-orig-size="853,575" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-21" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=750" src="https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=853" alt="" class="wp-image-6774" srcset="https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png 853w, https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=150 150w, https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=300 300w, https://cyclope2.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/image-21.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/energy-intensity-of-passenger-transport-modes-2018"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Source: IEA (2020) Energy Intensity of Passenger Transport Modes, 2018.

            <p>The only reason that planes aren&#8217;t that much worse than cars – as far as energy required per passenger-km, is that they can hold many people at once and are often full [that&#8217;s why private jets, for example, are such terrible polluters]. On the other hand, cars are often half-empty. Also, note that a single plane trip emits far more than a single car trip, but that&#8217;s really just due to the difference in distances travelled.</p>
            <h5 id="ships-and-boats"><strong>Ships and Boats</strong></h5>
            <p>Boats are pretty big polluters as well. In 2018, shipping emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.86</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents over 10% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 8.6 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Shipping&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were nearly <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">38</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Additionally, oil spills can occur when ships crash or leak. That can be absolutely devastating to local populations and biodiversity. Media coverage has been present for a few of these oil spills in the past [while some went completely unnoticed] – so we know exactly how terrible these spills are for local health, food, and economy.</p>
            <p>As far as international freight transport goes, there&#8217;s no question that boats emit much less GHGs per unit weight of cargo than aircrafts. While both boats and planes end up emitting roughly the same amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> every year, we have to put that in perspective with the massive quantities of goods that ships transport. For example, maritime shipping accounted for roughly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/International_trade_in_goods_by_mode_of_transport#Trade_by_mode_of_transport_in_value_and_quantity">75</a>% of imported/exported goods [by weight] between the EU and the rest of the world in 2019. On the other hand, aircrafts were mostly used to transport higher-value products. </p>
            <p>If our goal is to reduce the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions as a whole – then we&#8217;re going to have to transition away from using airplanes for freight transport.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, boats still pollute since they burn fuel [often burning highly polluting residual fuel left after oil refining processes]. Large and heavy ones especially, so it&#8217;s not very surprising that cruise ships are being <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4277147/a-cruise-ship-s-emissions-are-the-same-as-1-million-cars-report-1.4277180">scrutinized</a> extensively for the damages they incur to the environment. After all, who would have thought that running a huge hotel solely on oil as an energy source could pollute so much?</p>
            <h5 id="trucks-and-cars"><strong>Trucks and Cars</strong></h5>
            <p>Trucks and cars emit way too many GHGs and toxic pollutants. In 2018, passenger and freight road vehicles emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">6.0</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents over 73% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 60 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This has not been getting better. Road transport&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were over <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">41</a>% higher than they were in 2000.</p>
            <p>Heavier vehicles like trucks consume more fuel and emit more GHGs per km than lightweight cars. However, there are other factors that can increase our individual emissions as well, like speed. Speeding on a highway burns more fuel than driving at the speed limit, even when considering the amount of fuel saved from the trip being completed early.</p>
            <p>Additionally, while gasoline may not be scrutinized as much as jet fuel, it remains a terrible polluter that nearly releases the same amount of GHGs per kg of fuel consumed. </p>
            <p>Road vehicles are astounding polluters because they are individualized. As such, the easiest thing to do to cut our transportation emissions in half is to carpool with one other person. Divide by three? Two people. This is why buses, although heavier, can emit much <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/PublicTransportationsRoleInRespondingToClimateChange2010.pdf">less</a> CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger-km. Improving shared services like public transit is by far one of the best ways to ensure cleaner mobility in cities and neighboring areas.</p>
            <h5 id="rail"><strong>Rail</strong></h5>
            <p>Trains have been one of the cleanest transportation modes for a while now, ever since most of them ditched coal many moons ago. In 2018, rail emitted <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.08</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>. That represents just 1% of the transportation sector&#8217;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions the same year – equivalent to roughly 0.8 billion pandas emitted.</p>
            <p>This is getting better, despite passenger rail usage <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">almost doubling</a> from 1996-2016. Rail&#8217;s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018 were <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">2.4</a>% lower than they were in 2000. That&#8217;s partly due to around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">75</a>% of passenger trains worldwide relying on electricity as a power source in 2016– a considerable increase from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">60</a>% in 2000.</p>
            <p>Trains are without a doubt the most eco-friendly way to travel long distances. Despite accounting for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">7</a>% of freight and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">8</a>% of passenger transportation worldwide, rail only accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail">2</a>% of the transportation sector&#8217;s energy demand in 2016. </p>
            <p>Even for short distances, urban rail is proving <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/fb7dc9e4-d5ff-4a22-ac07-ef3ca73ac680/The_Future_of_Rail.pdf">very energy efficient</a>. However, for trains to really show how eco-friendly they are, we need people to use them. And that means reducing the cost of a ticket considerably. What message are we sending if the cost of low emission travel is terribly expensive? And for that matter, why are we even charging for public transit? Reducing individual transportation is one of the eco-friendliest solutions out there, but it simply can&#8217;t happen until public transit offers cheap fares for short and long distances alike. Government policies and subsidies for cleaner travel would be far more effective if concentrated on improving shared services, instead of other individualized solutions.</p>
            <h5 id="electric-vehicles"><strong>Electric Vehicles</strong></h5>
            <p>Electric vehicles [EVs] run on electricity stored chemically in batteries in the car &#8216;floor&#8217; [other types of EVs exist, but battery EVs are the most common]. These batteries are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9991">extremely</a> heavy for the amount of energy stored [low energy density], whereas gasoline has decent energy density. As a result, an EV weighs much more than a similarly sized combustion vehicle [CV].</p>
            <p>EV manufacturers are always looking to improve the range of their vehicles. We could just load the car with more batteries, but this would increase the car&#8217;s weight. And, if the mass of the vehicle increases, then so does power consumption. That&#8217;s part of the challenge of increasing EV range. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an easy solution, since loading up more batteries would increase both the energy supply and consumption of an EV.</p>
            <p>The solution for increasing the range isn&#8217;t in the number of batteries, it&#8217;s inside the batteries. Researchers worldwide are working on increasing the energy density and lifetime of batteries. In 2018-2019, the battery energy density in average electric vehicles was <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">20-100</a>% higher than it was in 2012, while battery costs have decreased by over <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">85</a>% since 2010. Governments and companies are also working on increasing the number of charging stations along popular travel routes to fight against range anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>2 Important EV Problems </strong></p>
            <p>While EVs are becoming <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">increasingly common</a>, they have their fair share of challenges. </p>
            <p>First, batteries require loads of components and metals. For example, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">19</a> kilotonnes of cobalt, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17</a> kt of lithium, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">22</a> kt of manganese, and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">65</a> kt of nickel were required to make batteries for EVs sold in 2019. If over a million pandas-worth of metals doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot, stay with us.</p>
            <p>As of 2019, the total worldwide supply of lithium was <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">77</a> kt per year across all industries, with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">21</a>% of that being used for EV production. By 2030, lithium demand for EVs alone is required to increase to at least <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">365.3</a> kt per year to align with the Sustainable Development Scenario – much higher than the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17</a> kt required in 2019. </p>
            <p>That&#8217;s just for lithium and EVs. We already know that renewables depend on this metal for energy storage, as do high-tech devices. And unfortunately, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">similar projections</a> exist for other metals that are critical to battery production – like cobalt, manganese, and nickel.</p>
            <p>Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that we won&#8217;t be able to meet this projected demand by 2030. However, we&#8217;re going to need to increase mining activity considerably – which will increase energy consumption and other mining impacts as well. </p>
            <p>Alas, it won&#8217;t stop there. There were &#8216;only&#8217; <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">7.2</a> million EVs on the road in 2019, compared to over 1 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/">billion</a> CVs. The massive increase in mining activity described above is only projected to help EVs reach <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-share-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">13.4</a>% of the total car share by 2030 – up from <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-share-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030">0.8</a>% in 2019. If EVs are supposed to replace all CVs in the future, we can expect this increasing mining activity to continue for decades.</p>

            <p>The following graph shows how important and metal-intensive batteries will be in the upcoming green revolution. How we decide to adopt EVs [i.e. at an individual scale or for public transit] will have massive implications on mining activity and the speed at which we complete our energy transition. </p>

            <p>The second problem is really an electricity production problem. If our global electricity mix is still <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">37</a>% coal and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% Big 3, then recharging our EVs still has a considerable footprint [although that will depend on local electricity mixes]. </p>
            <p>Combining the metal supply and electricity mix problems, let&#8217;s see what we&#8217;ve got. Unsurprisingly, comparing a mid-sized EV [40 kWh battery pack] with a similarly sized CV [6.8 L/100 km] has shown that the EV emits <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">33-57</a>% more GHGs during manufacturing, which makes sense since the average EV is made with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">6 times</a> the mineral inputs required to make a CV.</p>
            <p><em>Helpful note for the following paragraph: the &#8216;CO<sub>2</sub>e&#8217; or &#8216;CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent&#8217; unit accounts for all GHGs and their greenhousiness, not just CO<sub>2</sub>.</em></p>
            <p>On the other hand, fuel impacts depend heavily on the electricity mix and the fuel consumption of the CV. For an electricity emission factor of 50 g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh, it&#8217;s estimated that EVs would emit <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">94.7</a>% less than CVs during fuel consumption [with an assumed lifetime of 200,000 km for both vehicles]. However, for an electricity emission factor of 800 g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/100 km, that lowers to just <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">15.3</a>% less than CVs during fuel consumption.</p>

All rights reserved.</span></a> </figcaption></figure></div>
            <p>Combining both production and fuel consumption, we can conclude that in the low-carbon electricity mix, EVs end up emitting <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/comparative-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-a-mid-size-bev-and-ice-vehicle">73.0-76.4</a>% less than CVs over a 200,000 km lifetime – or just <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary">5.0-8.4</a>% less in a high-carbon electricity mix. Consequently, it&#8217;s incredibly important that individuals look up their local electricity emission factors to ensure that they&#8217;re not doing more harm than good – on top of the whole &#8216;metal-intensiveness&#8217; issue. For reference, the US national average grid electricity emission factor is around <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021-04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf">400</a> g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh in 2021 – while the EU had an emission factor of <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/co2-emission-intensity-6#tab-googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_chart_11111">275</a> g of CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh in 2019 [keep in mind that regional emission factors can be very different from local ones].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that lower fuel-consumption for CVs can also help slash the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions significantly. With more research and stronger regulations, we could design and offer affordable fuel-efficient vehicles [e.g. under 2 L/100 km] – which could help us reduce our impacts even further.</p>
            <p><strong>EV Conclusion</strong></p>
            <p>Although we&#8217;ve made great strides and are starting to see electric vehicles on the road more frequently, we should be careful of their collateral damage. It&#8217;s great that the public opinion is shifting in favor of decarbonizing the atmosphere. That should be our priority. However, like renewable energy technology – if we are too quick to adopt a &#8216;half-good&#8217; solution, we&#8217;ll end up creating more problems than we started with.</p>
            <p>The best solution is using our technology in moderation, where it makes sense to do so. EVs are helping and will continue to help lower the transportation sector&#8217;s GHG emissions. This will be even more evident as our global electricity mix further decarbonizes. However, we simply don&#8217;t have the resources for everybody to make the switch to EVs. Even if we did, digging up all the metals required would prove incredibly damaging to the environment and could slow down our energy transition.</p>
            <p>Our first priority shouldn&#8217;t be jumping the gun and banning new CV purchases by 2050, as many countries have ambitiously declared. Neither should it be to reject all EVs because they aren&#8217;t as clean as advertised. The most important thing we can do now is reduce our dependence on individual transportation while demanding improved-cheap public transit. At the same time, we can focus on electrifying public transit [e.g. with trams/streetcars, rail, EV buses, etc&#8230;], since public transportation is the future of eco-friendly travel.</p>
            <h5 id="artificial-intelligence"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h5>
            <p>Artificial intelligence [AI] has the potential to reduce the transportation sector&#8217;s emissions, especially for public transport. It could allow our cities to become well-oiled machines, where efficiency rules. This would reduce fuel waste, encourage the use of public transport, and redefine vehicle sharing apps.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re still years [or decades] of investments, research, and trials away from driverless vehicles becoming available to the public. Additionally, even if the technology were proven and integrated in our societies, a driverless vehicle wouldn&#8217;t magically stop consuming fuel. Although fuel consumption could be optimized with efficient AI software and car-to-car communication [e.g. to reduce traffic], that would barely make a dent in the sector&#8217;s total emissions. Without mentioning the hidden impacts that this type of AI technology can have [e.g. data storage]. As we&#8217;ve stated previously, a shift to public-transit-dominated societies is required.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, driverless vehicles could one day revolutionize public transit by driving people that don&#8217;t live near public transit routes to the nearest station. This could help us replace buses that run with little to no passengers with mini shuttles. These driverless shuttles would then operate at lower costs and lower fuel consumption – since they wouldn&#8217;t have drivers and would be much lighter than large buses. </p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles would also be pivotal for car-sharing applications when public transit isn&#8217;t an option, to reduce the number of cars in the world [by reducing the number of cars not in use]. While this wouldn&#8217;t necessarily reduce the number of cars in use at any given moment, AI algorithms could help with that by making carpooling and car-sharing much more convenient. </p>

            <p>Transportation accounted for&nbsp;28% of global final energy demand in 2017 and roughly 23% of&nbsp;global CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions&nbsp;in 2018. Since vehicles are extremely energy intensive and polluting, the transportation sector is an innovator’s dream.</p>
            <p>Passenger transportation is responsible for around 63% of total transportation energy use, while freight transport accounts for the remaining 37%. Globalization has allowed us to travel and trade goods over great distances, but our environment is once again paying the price. </p>
            <p>Aviation, shipping, and road vehicles have all increased their emissions in recent years, while rail continues to prove it&#8217;s the cleanest motorized transportation mode out there. Unfortunately, expensive train tickets are preventing people from reducing their footprint over long and short distances alike. To reduce environmental impacts, we&#8217;ll need to reevaluate whether eco-friendly public transit methods like buses, streetcars, or rail are really something we want to discourage with expensive fares. </p>
            <p>After taking the world by storm, electric vehicles&#8217; challenges are coming to light, slowly but surely. The pursuit for longer ranges with advances in battery efficiency will continue to titillate the research world, but that should be the least of our concerns. First, the EV industry relies on loads of finite resources, especially metals required for battery manufacturing. While it&#8217;s unsure whether we&#8217;ll be able to supply the EV industry with the amounts of metal it will require over the next decades, it is certain that doing so would have adverse effects – ranging from mining impacts to the finiteness of metals. Second, electrifying our transport is great, but we need to ensure it makes sense with our electricity mixes. An EV in a region dominated by coal for electricity production risks being counterproductive.</p>
            <p>Again, prioritizing public transit to reduce the number of cars on the road is the only surefire way to decrease environmental impacts in the long term. That requires much lower fares for long distance rail and city transit. And yes, electrifying public transit will be essential, but only because it makes sense to do so at that scale. Governments and companies can reduce the global transportation sector&#8217;s impacts considerably in the near future, if the right policies and solutions are adopted now.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence will also help reduce the number of cars in the world and on the road, although this type of technology is not without impacts on the environment either. With the proper systems in place, driverless vehicles will increase carpooling and make public transit an even better option. However, driverless vehicles aren&#8217;t available yet, with no guarantee of when they&#8217;ll roll out and help streamline public transit – so we&#8217;ll have to stick to proven solutions for now.</p>

            <p>In 2018, food systems accounted for roughly&nbsp;33% of our global GHG emissions [note that many reports have more cautious estimates, like the IPCC’s&nbsp;21-37% range]. Unsurprisingly, the farming stage – where crops or animals are grown – is responsible for the majority of our food system&#8217;s emissions. </p>
            <p>On top of these emissions, farmlands [i.e. croplands and pastures] cover around half of the Earth&#8217;s habitable surface. With our current food system, that fraction is projected to rise to satisfy the demands of an increasing and increasingly wealthy population. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a shortage of arable land in the world, and deforestation for agriculture is not a very good alternative. We&#8217;re going to have to rely on trees and their biodiversity to sequester carbon in the future, so destroying our long-term ally for an immediate result doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense. That is, if there&#8217;s a way to change our current unsustainable food systems.</p>
            <p>Animal-free diets are much better for the environment, in every single way. Between livestock consuming roughly a third of all grown crops, releasing massive amounts of GHGs, and causing roughly 67% of deforestation for agriculture, we have loads of reasons to adapt to different diets. </p>
            <p>Basing our food systems around livestock production just doesn&#8217;t make sense. To feed the animals, we revert to land use conversion and/or provide livestock with nutritious plant-based meals, only to recover a fraction of the calories and protein input later.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of policies and subsidies that governments can implement or remove to increase food security sustainably. However, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that unsustainable diets will have to change. It&#8217;s also important to note that it&#8217;s much harder for producers to adopt more sustainable practices than it is for consumers to refine their diet. Producers are located in distinct parts of the world and operate at very different scales, so one farmer&#8217;s sustainable actions may not be suitable for the rest.</p>
            <p>Plant-based diets can help the food industry reduce its land use by several million km<sup>2</sup> by 2050, which would help us restore green ecosystems worldwide. They could also help lower the food system&#8217;s GHG emissions by up to 8.0 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year by 2050. Developed countries and heavy meat eaters have the opportunity to cut down on their emissions the most, although it will take time. This transition can be facilitated by governments and food companies by effectively communicating food products&#8217; impacts to customers. And as always, buying local, in season, and not wasting are surefire ways to decrease your footprint.</p>
            <p>Food wastage reflects that it&#8217;s not just diets that need to change, it&#8217;s the whole food system. We can&#8217;t keep wasting a third of food produced for humans if our goal is to increase food security – while not destroying precious ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Food is an extremely polarizing topic due to its importance in our everyday lives and its massive impacts on the environment. In 2018, food systems released about <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">16</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e in the atmosphere [160 billion pandas] – equivalent to roughly <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">33</a>% of our global GHG emissions the same year [note that many reports have more cautious estimates, like the IPCC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/">21-37</a>% range].</p>
            <p>Including the effects of land use conversion like deforestation, the farming stage [i.e. excluding food transport, supply chains, or waste disposal] accounted for <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">65</a>% of food&#8217;s GHG emissions in 2018. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s more to it than just GHGs. Our food systems also caused <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">32</a>% of terrestrial acidification and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">78</a>% of eutrophication in 2018, which can both destroy ecosystems and induce biodiversity loss. </p>
            <p>Many factors can increase a food product&#8217;s footprint, such as cooking methods, transportation, and packaging – but it&#8217;s clear that the farming stage has the highest impacts of them all. So that&#8217;ll be the main focus of this section. </p>
            <p>Personal diets aside, it&#8217;s important to understand that our food systems are causing environmental crises in some of the most biodiverse parts of the world. Simply put, we need the current food system to change to become more eco-friendly. Not only to reduce our present impacts, but also to ensure a secure food access to an increasing – and increasingly demanding population.  </p>
            <h5 id="land-and-population"><strong>Land and Population </strong></h5>
            <p>In 2019, around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">51</a> million km<sup>2</sup> of land were used for agriculture [includes pastures for animals and fields for crops]. That represents around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">50</a>% of the Earth&#8217;s habitable land area. Unfortunately, it won&#8217;t stop there if we don&#8217;t change our food systems – since we&#8217;ll soon need more food for our growing population. In fact, worldwide food production is expected to grow by roughly <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i6583e/i6583e.pdf">48</a>% from 2013-2050. </p>
            <p>On top of population growth, many densely populated countries are still developing, and their populations are getting richer. Many who were constrained to eat smaller rations of local products can now eat larger meals like developed countries – with ingredients imported from all over the world. For example, China&#8217;s middle class – which has grown from roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/875874/middle-class-population-in-china/#:~:text=Number%20of%20middle%20class%20population%20in%20China%202002%2D2020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20number,approximately%20700%20million%20by%202020.">80</a> million in 2002 to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/875874/middle-class-population-in-china/#:~:text=Number%20of%20middle%20class%20population%20in%20China%202002%2D2020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20number,approximately%20700%20million%20by%202020.">700</a> million in 2020 – has increased the country&#8217;s average meat intake significantly in the past <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47057341">60</a> years [the graph below also shows the strong relationship between income and meat consumption]. Same goes for Brazil, another densely populated nation.</p>

            <p>To recap, food demand is increasing because of population growth, but also since the demand per capita is increasing in densely populated areas. </p>
            <p>Now to ensure food security, we need to produce more food. To produce more food, we need more crops. And for that, we need more arable land [we&#8217;ll see in a later section that changing our agricultural practices can also lead to more food production].</p>
            <p>The ever-increasing demand for arable land is a big problem since we don&#8217;t really discover new land every day. Our current solution seems to be burning/cutting down forests and other green ecosystems to allow crops to grow instead &#8211; which is proving very costly for the environment. We simply can&#8217;t afford to damage our vegetation – as it absorbs roughly a <a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/">quarter</a> of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every year. That helps mitigate climate change, while land use conversion [e.g. deforestation] accelerates it. Vegetation also holds an incredible amount of biodiversity, so cutting down these forests results in biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s not all about land either. Aquatic ecosystems are being severely polluted because of our unsustainable food practices [e.g. chemical runoff causing eutrophication]. Fishing and aquaculture farms are threatening many marine ecosystems as well, mainly through careless fishing techniques and over-fishing [fun fact: some predatory farmed fish species can require loads of wild fishing to feed them].</p>
            <p>Instead of resorting to land use conversion, pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modifying our crops to increase food production temporarily, let&#8217;s see how easy it is to improve our food systems from the consumer side of things.</p>
            <h5 id="food-emissions-and-land-use"><strong>Food Emissions and Land Use</strong></h5>
            <p>No matter our diet, it&#8217;s important to understand how much our food pollutes before we eat it. The following graph shows the extent to which different products release GHG emissions during their life-cycle. Quickly zooming in on the next graph and finding the ingredients we eat the most can help us acknowledge how our everyday meals impact the environment.</p>

            <p>Clearly, animal products are the highest-impact foods. However, there are a few other products that emit loads of emissions as well – like coffee, chocolate, and oils.</p>
            <p>Whether we eat meat or not, we all consume some of the foods shown in the graph. And we&#8217;re not the only ones. Cattle [i.e. cows and bulls] don&#8217;t only eat grass like they do in cartoons, just like pigs don&#8217;t eat mud.</p>
            <p>While ruminants [e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, etc&#8230;] do consume roughly <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">2.7</a> billion tonnes of grass per year and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">65</a>% of this grass grows on unfarmable lands – that still leaves 35% of grazed land where lower impact foods could be grown instead. And more importantly, neither of those percentages account for the massive proportion of our crops that are grown in other parts of the world to end up as livestock [i.e. all farm animals] feed. It&#8217;s estimated that around a <a href="https://drawdown.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/DrawdownPrimer_FoodAgLandUse_Dec2020_01c.pdf">third</a> of all crops are grown to feed livestock, using <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/05/30/360.6392.987.DC1/aaq0216-Poore-SM-revision1.pdf">38</a>% of our arable and permanent croplands worldwide. </p>
            <p>Regardless of whether livestock eat grass or feed, it&#8217;s simply undeniable that they take up a lot of room. And with the significant increase in animal product consumption in recent decades, that has only led to agricultural expansion.</p>

            <h5 id="agricultural-expansion"><strong>Agricultural Expansion</strong></h5>
            <p>We&#8217;ve stated earlier that farmlands [i.e. land for crop and livestock farming] cover around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">50</a>% of the Earth&#8217;s habitable surface. Since the Earth is fully booked, increasing that percentage ever so slightly has usually led to deforestation and land use conversion of other green ecosystems. In fact, it’s estimated that agriculture was responsible for around&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/online/ca8642en.html#chapter-5_1">73</a>% of tropical deforestation worldwide from 2000-2010 [with tropical deforestation accounting for roughly&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation">95</a>% of total deforestation]. That&#8217;s a pretty big problem considering vegetation sequestrates loads of carbon in biomass and soils – while land use conversion releases that carbon back into the atmosphere. This helps explain why land use conversion is one of agriculture&#8217;s highest GHG-emitting activities. </p>
            <p>On the surface, it might seem like croplands are responsible for most of the deforestation occurring within the food industry, instead of livestock. If we dig deeper though, we find that animal products have the largest impacts once again. That&#8217;s because roughly <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">67</a>% of deforestation for agriculture aims to grow livestock feed. <em>Deforestation for agriculture is the process of clearing trees to use the land for agriculture. This type of land use conversion has significant impacts on the environment, such as biodiversity loss and releasing the carbon stored in the soil or biomass.</em></p>
            <p>The industry is well aware of the lack of space. We simply don&#8217;t have room to grow food for so many animals.</p>

            <p>Aside from deforestation, the industry&#8217;s current solution seems to be reducing each animal&#8217;s living space so that they&#8217;re only able to move a few inches in a certain direction. Not only is this an inhumane solution, it&#8217;s also unsustainable. Instead of dealing with the consequences of the problem, we should try and modify the root cause – only then will we come up with food systems that we can sustain for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <h5 id="food-s-inefficiencies-and-the-food-chain"><strong>Food&#8217;s Inefficiencies and the Food Chain</strong></h5>
            <p>CyclopediApp is devoted to pointing out inefficiencies in our current energy and resource consumption systems. Eating meat is one of those inefficiencies. Per unit weight or protein content, it&#8217;s easy to see that livestock consume <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production">more</a> food than they give back. While that would be acceptable if they were only eating inedible food scraps [i.e. feed requires no additional land or resources], we know that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

            <p>These inefficiencies make sense because that&#8217;s how the food chain works. When we eat food, our bodies consume the calories, protein, and other nutrients needed to make sure we remain alive and [ideally] healthy. However, unless we&#8217;re building muscle, those &#8216;food elements&#8217; aren&#8217;t really stored anywhere. So if anyone tried to eat us, they wouldn&#8217;t get all the food elements we got when we ate our food. In other words, we tax a certain amount of energy and nutrients from our food that can&#8217;t be retrieved if we ever get eaten. This is particularly true once we&#8217;ve stopped building muscle – although we still impose taxes on food elements when growing and building muscle [taxes are just a little lower].</p>
            <p>The same is true for the animals/plants we eat. When eating a food, we only consume a part of the food elements that this food has received from its food [and so on]. So if we ate a cow for example, then we&#8217;d only be getting a small part of the food elements that it got from grass or feed. In other words, cows are imposing a pretty hefty tax on us. To avoid this tax [i.e. to avoid inefficiencies in our food systems], we&#8217;d have to get lower on the food chain. This is the one of the main reasons why eating our &#8216;food&#8217;s food&#8217; can help us reduce our impacts on the environment. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than just the food chain. There are additional emission sources for different animals and farming practices – varying from enteric fermentation [with ruminant digestion], to aquaculture, and even manure. On top of just being fed, livestock have many other needs – including frequent antibiotic and growth promoting supplements [i.e. medicine and steroids]. The graph below shows that cattle GHG emissions are primarily released by enteric fermentation [in low emission farms], which indicates that the most efficient way to reduce cattle emissions is to reduce their population sizes.</p>

            <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb4474en">720-811</a>&nbsp;million humans having suffered from hunger in 2020, it&#8217;s tough to see livestock get a priority on food and medicine.</p>
            <h5 id="reducing-food-s-impacts"><strong>Reducing Food&#8217;s Impacts</strong></h5>
            <p>There are plenty of policies and subsidies that governments can implement or remove to increase food security sustainably. As always, these types of large-scale solutions are the most effective ones. However, it&#8217;s important for individuals to understand that unsustainable diets will have to change if we plan on reducing our impacts on the environment – no matter how successful the large-scale solutions are. </p>
            <p>Transitioning toward animal-free diets could help the food industry reduce its land use by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/210714-IPCCJ7230-SRCCL-Complete-BOOK-HRES.pdf">several million km<sup>2</sup></a> by 2050, which would help us restore green ecosystems worldwide. Additionally, phasing out animal products could help us lower the food system&#8217;s GHG emissions by up to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/210714-IPCCJ7230-SRCCL-Complete-BOOK-HRES.pdf">8.0</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year by 2050.</p>
            <p>Evidently, heavier meat eaters can make the greatest changes in their diets – so developed countries have the highest potential for GHG emissions reduction. For reference, meat consumption per capita in the US is over <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f/download_file?file_format=pdf&amp;safe_filename=Reducing_foods_environment_impacts_Science%2B360%2B6392%2B987%2B-%2BAccepted%2BManuscript.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Journal+article">3</a> times the global average.</p>
            <p>However, it&#8217;s important to remain realistic. While there&#8217;s certainly an urgency to adopt more sustainable diets, not everyone can change their habits overnight – which is okay. We just can&#8217;t take too long, since we need to start reducing our impacts now, not in a few years. </p>
            <p>Apart from self-banning categories of foods, it&#8217;s quite hard for consumers to do more. At that point, we&#8217;d need more information when selecting which foods to buy at the grocery store. For that to happen, governments and companies will have to collaborate to make sure that impacts for all food products are fairly evaluated and properly communicated to consumers. A simple example would be a little sticker on food products that indicates the amount of GHG emissions released during the entire production process. Alone, these types of numbers won&#8217;t help much – but official standards and certifications have the potential to help consumers compare similar products and guide more sustainable purchases [e.g. &#8216;fair-trade&#8217; certification].</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s much harder for producers to adopt more sustainable practices than it is for consumers to refine their diet. Since the world&#8217;s <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">570</a>+ million farms employ different methods, are located in different environments, and have different sizes – there aren&#8217;t many solutions that can help increase sustainability across the board. In other words, what reduces impacts for a small farmer in Ukraine may do the opposite for large farming corporations in Brazil. Nonetheless, improving farming practices for the largest farming companies can drastically reduce the food sector&#8217;s emissions.</p>
            <h5 id="wastage"><strong>Wastage</strong></h5>
            <p>Wastage, which comprises both food waste and food loss – has devastating impacts on the environment. Here are a few concerning factoids, as of 2013:</p>
            <ul><li><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.3</span></a> billion tonnes of edible food are wasted or lost every year [13 billion pandas].</li><li>A <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">third</span></a> of all food produced for humans results in food wastage.</li><li><a style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);" href="http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">250</span></a><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"> km</span><sup style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">3</sup><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);"> of freshwater are used to produce food that is either lost or wasted each year.

            <p>It&#8217;s extremely disappointing to see so many resources exploited to grow crops, only to see it all go to waste at some point during the production process, or later by consumers. Keep in mind the values listed were released in 2013, so they have surely changed a bit since. More recently, a 2021 UN report estimated that <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-17-all-food-available-consumer-levels-wasted">931</a> million tonnes – or <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-17-all-food-available-consumer-levels-wasted">17</a>% – of all food available at consumer levels is wasted every year, mostly by individuals. That&#8217;s 9.31 billion pandas-worth of food per year, which is over 1 panda per human every year.</p>
            <p>This wastage isn&#8217;t really surprising given that our food systems operate with the same careless methods that other industries are governed by [e.g. fast fashion]. Essentially, supermarkets would rather waste than be out of stock for a few days, so they buy too much – and consumers do the same. Luckily, even if we don&#8217;t change our over-consumerism methods soon, food wastage can still be minimized by donating food on the brink of spoilage to those in need [as some governments have enforced]. </p>
            <p>Local products are far less likely to spoil if purchased and require less transportation than imported foods. As such, wastage can be avoided with better food chain systems that avoid long transportation routes for highly perishable items [e.g. produce, meat]. </p>
            <p>The graph below shows one way to deal with food wastage.</p>

            <h5 id="food-security"><strong>Food Security</strong></h5>
            <p>While we could think that reducing food wastage means reducing food production and thus food security – that&#8217;s not the case. Many regions of the world already <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/agriculture/">suffer</a> from food insecurity and hunger, although global wastage rates are high – so we could simply reduce food wastage by sharing food with the hungry. This would effectively increase global food security, while maintaining current global production if need be. </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, we should note that completely eliminating global food wastage is neither a realistic nor desirable goal, since it would weaken global food security considerably.</p>
            <p>We should also note that increasing meat consumption in impoverished areas can have positive effects on local food security – which could be worth the high-impacts [e.g. with cattle fed from grass on local unfarmable lands]. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this is not the case in developed countries where high meat consumption is clearly unsustainable and continues to strain the world&#8217;s remaining natural resources.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Governments and companies have a lot of work to do to improve food systems swiftly at the largest scales and should be focused on better policies/farming practices – instead of placing the blame on consumers. However, it has to be clear that we can&#8217;t go on with our unsustainable diets. There&#8217;s simply no way we can keep them up for long – without mentioning the damage they incur to the environment. </p>

            <h5 id="individuals"><strong>INDIVIDUALS</strong></h5>
            <ul><li><strong>Reduce meat consumption.</strong> Adopt a plant-based diet. Alternatively, try a vegetarian diet. If you can&#8217;t swear off meat yet, go flexitarian – a fancy word to say you avoid meat as much as you can. If you can&#8217;t reduce your meat consumption yet, try to aim for the lowest impact meats [i.e. avoid ruminants].</li><li><strong>Forget about the labels.</strong> It&#8217;s easy to get stuck between 2 labels, because your diet doesn&#8217;t really match one of the diets mentioned above. If you need to eat meat once in a while, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t go vegan for the rest of your meals. It doesn&#8217;t make you a phony either. There are 0 constraints when changing your diet to reduce your footprint.</li><li><strong>Try new things.</strong> When changing your diet, the most important step is trying out alternatives. Especially when meat and dairy alternatives are improving every day. Individuals eating 3 meals a day end up eating close to 1,100 meals a year – so it shouldn&#8217;t hurt to try out a few weird-looking plant-based recipes once in a while. If you&#8217;re a fan of specific meat-based recipes, try subbing in another ingredient. If you don&#8217;t like it, that&#8217;s just 1/1,100 meals – keep trying. </li><li><strong>Find your high-impact foods.</strong> Try determining which of the foods you consume are considered high-impact, and see if you can find any better alternatives. </li><li><strong>Buy local and sustainable ingredients directly from the farm [i.e. at a farmer&#8217;s market].</strong> We should note that buying local doesn&#8217;t really help you lower your footprint that much. Instead, it&#8217;s more about encouraging small-scale farming, promoting sustainable producers, reducing food wastage from transport and supermarkets, and boosting your local economy.</li><li><strong>Grow a garden.</strong> Cultivating your own veggies inside or outside is a surefire way to reduce your footprint. Try growing local foods so that no extra irrigation is needed. Small gardens are low maintenance but a very big flex. </li><li><strong>Buy in season.</strong> Keeping up with which veggies grow during which months might seem annoying at first, but remember that this won&#8217;t change too much as time goes on. In other words, getting familiar with vegetable seasons is a life skill. </li><li><strong>Stick to water.</strong> Juices and coffee, among other beverages, are pretty big water consumers when you consider the irrigation needed to harvest the crops. Funny enough, a glass of orange juice needs much more water than a glass of water. Worldwide coffee production also releases a significant amount of GHGs in the atmosphere every year.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t waste food or drinking water.</strong> Stay in control of your fridge to make sure ingredients will be used before going bad. If you made excess food, keep it as leftovers. If you have too many leftovers, consider freezing some for later. Donate foods from your shelves that you know you&#8217;ll never eat. Use all the parts of an ingredient [e.g. stems, peels, etc&#8230;].</li><li><strong>Become a responsible consumer. </strong>Buy close-to-expiring foods at the supermarket if you know you&#8217;ll be using the ingredient soon. Also, buy the ugly looking product instead of the perfectly shaped one. These 2 actions will help grocery stores avoid food waste.</li><li><strong>Adopt a &#8216;bulk mentality&#8217;, within reason.</strong> Buying in bulk can reduce packaging and save money, as long as none of it ends up wasted.</li><li><strong>Learn how to properly shotgun a beer.</strong> Some of the videos online are just pathetic. As a helpful hint, if you end up drenched – you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong.</li><li><strong style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">Stop cooking with fossil fuels, if possible. </strong><span style="background-color:var(--wp--preset--color--background);color:var(--wp--preset--color--foreground);font-family:var(--font-base, &quot;PT Sans&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Roboto&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;Cantarell&quot;, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif);">Switch to electrically powered devices if your local electricity mix is cleaner than natural gas [check your electricity emission factor to confirm].

For example, palm oil has been a driver of tropical deforestation for decades. However, it&#8217;s <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/palm-oil"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">such a productive crop</span></a> that replacing palm oil with another type of oil could end up having a greater impact. This is especially true since many palm oil producers have now moved on to more sustainable practices. In any case, looking for sustainability certifications for products that contain these types of ingredients is definitely a good call – since it remains important to avoid products that have not switched to more sustainable practices.</li></ul>

            <p>Household appliances are often sneaky energy consumers, far less scrutinized than HVAC systems. It&#8217;s important to understand that anything that heats, cools, lights up, or moves needs energy. For the residential sector, most of that energy is supplied in the form of electricity or natural gas. </p>
            <p>Electronics are important electricity consumers, but luckily there are easy ways to reduce energy waste from these types of devices. Notably, by reducing standby power with better policies for large scales, or by unplugging electronic devices for individuals. </p>
            <p>Then, there are numerous energy-consuming appliances that have made their way into almost every household in developed countries, for no good reason. Dryers are the prime example, as they continue to increase household energy consumption by replacing sustainable drying methods that really don&#8217;t need replacing. </p>
            <p>Lighting is responsible for 15% of electricity consumption and 5% of GHG emissions worldwide. Replacing current light bulbs with LED bulbs is an extremely easy way to reduce one&#8217;s footprint and electricity bill. Better policies could ensure that inefficient bulbs are swiftly replaced by LEDs.</p>
            <p>Water heaters are tricky. Although reducing the set temperature is an excellent way to reduce emissions, low temperatures can also bring on legionnaire&#8217;s bacteria. It&#8217;s important to follow the recommended settings to lower consumption safely. Doing so will help us reduce water heating&#8217;s energy requirements, which currently stand at around 16% of residential energy consumption in select IEA countries. That large percentage makes sense, because everything that uses hot water in a home or building piggy backs on the water heater.</p>
            <p>Governments can pass numerous policies that would effectively reduce our appliances&#8217; impacts. Companies can also contribute by producing better quality items that use less energy and last longer. As for individuals, we can reduce our consumption by using household appliances sparingly and effectively in our day-to-day lives. And most importantly, before purchasing any household appliance, we should always ask ourselves if we really need it.</p>

            segmentTitle:"Overview",
            segmentBody:`
            <p>If we&#8217;re going to discuss how we can improve energy efficiency and reduce material consumption in our everyday lives, we better mention household appliances. In 2019, household appliances were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/appliances-and-equipment">15</a>% of final electricity demand worldwide.</p>
            <p>Most appliances are powered by electricity or natural gas, like fridges, stoves, and most barbeque grills. Along with HVAC systems, this explains why the residential sector&#8217;s energy consumption is dominated by natural gas and electricity use [residential excludes transportation].</p>
            <h5 id="residential-energy-consumption"><strong>Residential Energy Consumption</strong></h5>
            <p>In general, everything that can heat, cool, light, or move needs energy. Our homes receive that energy as gas or electricity from local grids. While burning natural gas certainly emits CO<sub>2</sub>, we shouldn&#8217;t forget that electricity isn&#8217;t always better. As we&#8217;ve seen in an earlier section, around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">63</a>% of global electricity production in 2019 came from burning the Big 3 fossil fuels. </p>
            <p>Appliances like showers or faucets also require energy in the form of water pressure. Pressurization occurs in underground water pipes by pumps that consume <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/understanding-your-water-bill">energy</a> – but there&#8217;s not much individuals can do about that except reduce water consumption and check for leaks. There are similar &#8216;hidden&#8217; energy requirements for compressors, which are essentially just pumps for natural gas. </p>
            <p>Although most of us only pay energy bills once a month, we should always remember that our residential energy/water consumption emits GHGs and toxic emissions into our atmosphere – even before reaching our home.</p>
            <p><strong>A Bit More Context</strong></p>
            <p>Residential and commercial/public sectors, which rely on many household appliances, were responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/world-electricity-final-consumption-by-sector-1974-2018">48</a>% of worldwide electricity consumption in 2019. While that&#8217;s definitely significant, we should note that electricity consumption only accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">37</a>% of residential energy consumption in OECD countries [i.e. developed countries] in 2018– which shows that lots of energy is consumed outside of grid-distributed electricity, even in developed countries.</p>
            <p>By reducing our individual energy consumption in our households, we can help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The cool part is that we can do it all while chilling in our pajamas. </p>
            <p>We&#8217;ve already talked about how our HVAC systems take up over <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/temperature-control/">half</a> of residential energy consumption [on average in IEA developed countries], so we won&#8217;t revisit this. Instead, in this section we&#8217;ll focus on the non-HVAC half of our electricity and natural gas bills.</p>
            <h5 id="electronic-devices"><strong>Electronic Devices</strong></h5>
            <p>Pretty much anything plugged into a socket consumes electricity. For most devices, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if it&#8217;s turned on or not [but obviously they draw more power when &#8220;on&#8221;]. When appliances and devices like TVs, microwaves, or chargers are off, it turns out they still <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> &#8216;standby&#8217; power from the socket. </p>
            <p>In 1998, <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">0.6</a>% of total OECD CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were caused by standby power from the residential sector of those countries. That&#8217;s roughly the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions coming from <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2000/data/papers/SS00_Panel7_Paper08.pdf">24</a> million European-type cars the same year. </p>
            <p>Efforts have been made since to regulate standby power, with moderate success. For the last 20 years, governments around the world have implemented regulations to limit the standby power at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/Guidance%20document_Lot%2026_Networked%20Standby_clean%20FIN.pdf">0.5-1</a> W [Watt] per appliance. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not being respected by many manufacturers, as their products continue to <a href="https://standby.lbl.gov/data/summary-table/">draw</a> much more standby power than admissible.</p>
            <p>1 Watt isn&#8217;t a lot of power. The average US home consumes electricity at an <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3">average</a> rate of 1,215 W. Still, with all our household appliances combined – and accounting for the many appliances that don&#8217;t follow the 1 Watt-initiative – standby power can easily add up to <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/795944">1-10</a>% of our electricity bills. It can be even worse in commercial buildings that are flooded with electronic devices. </p>
            <p>Governments have to double down on limiting standby power. It&#8217;s not enough to simply have a policy in place if it isn&#8217;t respected by most electronic devices. As for individuals, one easy solution is just unplugging our appliances when we&#8217;re not using them. These types of individualized solutions aren&#8217;t very effective at bringing about meaningful change, but they can still help us reduce our personal impacts.</p>
            <p><strong>Dryers</strong></p>
            <p>There are also appliances like dryers that have somehow made their way into the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/ENERGY_STAR_Scoping_Report_Residential_Clothes_Dryers.pdf">vast majority</a> of households in some developed countries [e.g. US]. In these areas, dryers are marketed as the washing machine&#8217;s counterpart, making it seem like owning one wouldn&#8217;t make sense without the other. That&#8217;s simply untrue. Drying clothes on racks or on ropes has been done for ages, and 9/10 dentists say it works fine. On average, it takes 1-24 hours to dry clothes without a dryer, some of that depending on whether the clothes are dried inside or outside, and the type of material/thickness of the garment.</p>
            <p>We understand the need to live life on the edge, and waiting until we&#8217;re out of undies to do laundry is exhilarating [also good for the environment, laundry every 2 days is not a great plan]. However, doing laundry just before our last pair would help avoid using a dryer and will lower our electricity consumption. Lots of clothes aren&#8217;t even suited to go in the dryer anyway [women clothes seem especially shrinky], so everyone should already know how to air-dry clothes.&nbsp;If not, it&#8217;s a pretty straightforward process. </p>
            <h5 id="lighting"><strong>Lighting</strong></h5>
            <p>Like electronic devices, lighting is also included in our electricity bill. Globally, it&#8217;s estimated that lighting accounts for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">15</a>% of electricity consumption and <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/led">5</a>% of GHG emissions [note that lighting isn&#8217;t always considered an appliance]. Power consumption for lighting is extremely easy to reduce when you have access to electricity [i.e. when you don&#8217;t have to burn fossil fuels]. We&#8217;ll go over 2 easy ways to optimize your lighting efficiency and reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>First, we can replace our lightbulbs with LED bulbs. These types of bulbs are way more <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/how-energy-efficient-light">efficient</a> than other types.</p>

            <p>LED bulbs are only a tad more expensive, but it&#8217;s an investment that pays off quickly due to their incredible efficiency and lifetime. More importantly, it reduces our power consumption and consequently our footprint. For reference, it&#8217;s estimated that LEDs could save the US population an estimated $<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">26</a> billion USD per year while cutting electricity consumption for lighting nearly in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/rise-and-shine-lighting-world-10-billion-led-bulbs#:~:text=But%20much%20of%20the%20world,of%20worldwide%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.">half</a>. Better policies could ensure that inefficient bulbs are swiftly replaced by LEDs in the near future, instead of relying on individuals to make the smarter choice.</p>
            <p>Second, we can simply be better with lighting. For large scales, that can mean automatic light sensors combined with taking full advantage of sunlight when/where possible. Smart building automation systems can cut energy consumption in large buildings considerably. For individuals, that just means using natural lighting as much as possible and turning lights off when they&#8217;re not in use.</p>
            <h5 id="water-heaters"><strong>Water Heaters</strong></h5>
            <p>Water heating accounts for roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">16</a>% of residential energy consumption in select <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-indicators">IEA</a> developed countries, on average. While lowering the water heater temperature may sound like a good idea, it&#8217;s a tad more complicated than that. </p>
            <p>To improve water heating efficiency, building operators and homeowners can check the water heater&#8217;s temperature and make sure it&#8217;s at the lowest recommended setting. Doing so would result in less heat loss between the hot water tank and the surrounding air – and thus less energy would be required to continuously heat the water. Unfortunately, lowering it too much isn&#8217;t an option as it risks growing legionnaire&#8217;s bacteria.</p>
            <p>On top of adjusting our water heater settings, we can also try to reduce hot water consumption by either using less hot water or switching to colder water – or both. In any case, reducing hot water consumption can reduce energy consumption, since the water heater would have to replace less hot water in the tank. This can effectively reduce power consumption and emissions.</p>
            <p>Remarkably, water heaters allow other machines to appear quite eco-friendly [e.g. clothes washers, dishwashers]. For example, efficient dishwashers use around the same power as a hair <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">dryer</a> and can clean a load with around <a href="https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/how-much-energy-dishwasher-use">10-20</a> liters of water, which is much less than what most hand washing individuals use. However, the dishwasher only looks cute because it hides its real energy demand behind the water heater [we&#8217;re not saying &#8216;hand-washers&#8217; don&#8217;t use hot water as well, this is just to point out that <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/water-heating/reduce-hot-water-use-energy-savings">hot-water-using</a> appliances consume energy].</p>
            <p>The same goes for hot showers and especially baths. Relatively small bathtubs need around 120 L of hot water per use. That&#8217;s the equivalent of a 20-minute shower for low-flow shower heads [at 1.6 gallons per minute = 6.1 liters per minute]. For higher flow rates, that&#8217;s closer to a 13-minute shower [at 2.5 Gpm = 9.5 Lpm].</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
            <p>Governments can pass numerous policies that would effectively reduce our appliances&#8217; impacts. Companies can also contribute by producing better quality items that use less energy and last longer.</p>
            <p>As for individuals, there&#8217;s one common theme across all types of appliances. We can reduce our consumption by using household appliances sparingly and effectively in our day-to-day lives. To do so, we&#8217;ll have to look at our household items and evaluate whether their usage is worth wasting resources for. And most importantly, before purchasing any household appliance, we&#8217;ll have to ask ourselves one single question: do we really need it?</p>

For other appliances you use more frequently, it&#8217;s up to you. Just check to see if the power cords or plugs aren&#8217;t frayed first, to make sure it&#8217;s safe to do so. Also, make sure to pull on the plug itself and not the cable, to avoid damaging your cables [to be clear – not the metal part &#8211; pull the plastic exterior of the plug].</li><li><strong>Or at the very least turn the appliances off/put them in sleep mode when not in use.</strong></li><li><strong>Increase energy efficiency by avoiding redundancy.</strong> There are many opportunities to reduce energy consumption through increased sharing within a household – like doing a group laundry [instead of having individuals wash their clothes independently].</li><li><strong>Decrease your faucet or nozzle water flow rates.</strong> This essentially just means reducing the water speed from your nozzles or faucets.

            <p>Industry was responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">24</a>% of the world&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2018, with roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">8.5</a> Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> being released into the atmosphere [85 billion pandas]. As a whole, industry is responsible for <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/water/">19</a>% of global freshwater withdrawals, while industrial waste generation is over <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/30317">17</a> times higher than <a href="https://cyclopediapp.org/waste-management/">municipal solid waste</a> [with high-income countries generating the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/30317">most</a> industrial waste]. </p>
            <p>It&#8217;s difficult to evaluate all industries at once, since they all have different energy intensities and pollution levels. It&#8217;s also hard to evaluate all of them separately, because many industries aren&#8217;t well monitored – so estimating emissions and energy consumption is tricky. For those reasons, we&#8217;ll just go over a few of the most important industries that we haven&#8217;t seen already.</p>
            <p>The iron &amp; steel, cement, chemicals &amp; petrochemicals, pulp &amp; paper, and aluminum industries emit the most CO<sub>2</sub>. The first 3 alone are responsible for over <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">65</a>% of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

            <p>That dotted blue line isn&#8217;t a projection, it&#8217;s what needs to happen to align with the 2030 SDS [Sustainable Development Scenario]. That&#8217;ll be a difficult task considering industrial production is expected to grow during that time. To reduce yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 8.5 to 7.4 Gt to align with the SDS, industry needs to reduce emissions on average by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">1.2</a>% per year until 2030.</p>
            <p>Again, a tough challenge considering industrial energy consumption has increased on average by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">0.9</a>% annually from 2010-2018. Efficiency alone won&#8217;t help us get to the SDS goal – we&#8217;re going to need to slow down our energy demand.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s not very surprising that energy consumption keeps on increasing, since material demand has been consistently increasing as well. The respective demands for aluminum, plastics, and cement have all increased by at least <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">250</a>% between 1990-2018. That&#8217;s 3.5 times the 1990 demand for those materials – less than 30 years later. Demand for steel isn&#8217;t too far behind, with a 2018 demand <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">136</a>% higher than in 1990.</p>
            <p>Industry accounted for <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">37</a>% of the world&#8217;s final energy consumption, with roughly <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-and-efficient-heat-for-industry">2/3</a> of industrial energy demand being used for heat. In 2019, industry&#8217;s energy mix was dominated by fossil fuels at around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">69</a>%, followed by electricity at <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">21</a>%. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that much of this electricity was generated from burning fossil fuels as well, so fossil fuels actually account for more than 69% of the industrial energy mix. </p>
            <p>Solar thermal and geothermal, the technologies set to &#8220;revolutionize the industry sector&#8221; still account for less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">0.05</a>% of the industrial energy mix. Not too surprising considering that the renewable share of heat demand is only required to increase from <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">9.5</a>% to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020">13.2</a>% from 2018-2030 to align with the SDS.</p>
            <p>To recap, industry is extremely energy intensive and relies heavily on fossil fuels. Not a great combo.</p>

            <p>While we reduce our consumption at all scales, it&#8217;ll be essential for energy-intensive industries to make use of the best available technologies to maximize efficiency. At such an enormous scale, the slightest improvements can help reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions considerably. Remember that industries are nowhere near our individual scale, where our quest for more efficient products can easily end up polluting more.</p>
            <p>Better policies will be crucial to ensure that industries reduce their impacts swiftly.</p>
