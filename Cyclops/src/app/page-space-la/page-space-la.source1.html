            While the next few sections of ‘Laying the Foundation’ are focused on energy, it’s
            important to understand that polluting energy sources are just one part of the problem.
            We’ll go over numerous examples in the main sections – but for now, just remember that
            it’s not only about how we produce energy – it’s also about what we use it for.

        <ion-card-content>
            The 3 ‘R’s are the general rules we need to follow to reduce our impacts on the
            environment, at any scale. We’ll see in other sections that these rules are central
            pillars to lowering consumption across all sectors of our societies.

        <ion-card-content>
            We could extensively limit the need for reactive control with better preventive
            equipment and techniques. Not only would that help lower our energy bills, it would also
            help decrease residential energy demand considerably.

        <ion-card-content>
            Transportation accounted for 28% of global final energy demand in 2017 and roughly 23%
            of global CO2 emissions in 2018. Since vehicles are extremely energy intensive and
            polluting, the transportation sector is an innovator’s dream.

        <ion-card-content>
            While many view climate change, biodiversity loss,
            and pollution as 3 distinct yet interconnected parts of
            the environmental crisis, we decided to split pollution within
            the first 2 sub-crises. Seeing that pollution usually forces one of climate change or
            biodiversity loss, it seems redundant to consider it separately. Nonetheless, we’ll
            quickly review pollution here to understand how different types of waste infiltrate and
            damage the environment.

            Once the majority of us clue in that we can’t live without nature, we’ll start making
            decisions that make sense. Unfortunately, the world has other problems than just the
            environmental crisis right now – but nothing that better education and increased sharing
            of our resources can’t fix. Simply put, better education will help an increasing
            population shape a better future for itself.

            Money’s going to play a pivotal role in solving the environmental crisis. Money’s the
            reason things get done in our capitalist societies, and that’s great for a lot of
            people. Unfortunately, it’s also the reason a lot of eco-friendly solutions don’t get
            done – and that impacts everyone and everything on Earth.
