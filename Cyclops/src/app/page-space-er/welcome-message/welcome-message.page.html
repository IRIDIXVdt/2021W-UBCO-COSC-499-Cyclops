        <h1>“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”</h1>
        <p>Hello there! Welcome to CyclopediApp. Here, we explore the numerous industries and habits that contribute to
            the environmental crisis, especially through climate change and biodiversity loss. CyclopediApp is meant to
            inform anyone of these issues,
            equip them with reliable facts, and suggest concrete solutions to the common question: “Well how can I
            possibly help the environment?” We will give overviews of each issue and how they impact the environment,
            and explore all that can be done
            by businesses, communities, cities, and countries around the world. While large-scale solutions are
            certainly the most important ones, we will also provide solutions for individuals that want to reduce the
            impacts of their everyday lives.</p>
        <p>In the next version of CyclopediApp, you will be able to measure your progress as you explore the various
            issues and solutions – and contribute to change at the larger scales. CyclopediApp will also have multiple
            features that help individual
            voices reach large scale audiences, to allow you to easily affect meaningful change. This will be available
            soon.
        </p>
        <p>As mentioned, CyclopediApp focuses on the major contributors of climate change and biodiversity loss. We’ll
            see why these matter in the intro.</p>
        <p>We’ve broken down the polluting sectors of our societies into sections. The first few sections focus on
            laying the foundation, to make sure everyone can keep up when we get to the main sections. For each of these
            main sections, solutions to reduce
            impacts at all scales are listed. In addition, a summary is provided to help readers remember the most
            important topics discussed in each overview – without having to read the whole thing over again. The last
            few sections are bonus rounds,
            where condensed analyses will help readers retrieve important information and a few more solutions. We
            strongly recommend reading all sections in order.</p>
        <p>One of CyclopediApp’s main goals is to provide reliable facts about the environmental crisis and its main
            contributors. However, we don’t just want you to take our word for it, so we’ve provided the source for each
            statistic we present – allowing
            you to take a look for yourself. We encourage you to challenge these figures with some research of your own.
            As you roam the internet, simply remember that statistics may differ by a few percentages depending on the
            source – but they should
            still be close enough to get the point across.</p>
        <p>For this version of CyclopediApp, let us know if you find a reliable source that directly contradicts one of
            ours. Visit the Crowdsourcing tab for more information.</p>
