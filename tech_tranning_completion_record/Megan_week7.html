    <h4>Provide a definition for MVVM:</h4>
    <p>the Model View View-Model approach, the View is the presentation to the user, the View Model is both the presentation and the 
      presentation logic, user input with the view passes through here, and finally the model is the business logic and data, which works with 
      the user input from view model and sends the output back through view model to the view for the user. The Angular architecture can be 
      viewed as a MVVM variant.</p>
	
	<h4>Provide three ways a component can get hold of its dependencies:</h4>
    <p>1. an object can create a dependency itself, like with classes
      2. the dependent object can declare the other object as a global variable
      3. using dependency injections and pass the dependencies only where it's needed</p>
	
	<h4>Among the three options, which is the most favorable one and why?</h4>
    <p>dependency injections, this is more flexible than the first two options where dependencies are hard coded. Testing is also easier as the 
      dependent object doesn't need to know exactly how its dependencies work, only use it where it's needed.</p>
	
	<h4>What is DI, and role(s) does it involveï¼Ÿ</h4>
    <p>Dependency Injections let objects/components access services of other objects that it's dependent on without having to know how those objects work. The 
      four involved roles are:</p>
	<ol>
      <li>the service from the depency that will be injected in for use by the dependent object</li>
      <li>the client that is dependent upon the service - your component</li>
      <li>the interface that we work with to use the service once it's injected</li>
      <li>the injector entity that is imported into your component and is responsible for the service injection</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Provide some examples of Angular Router Terms:</h4>
    <p>History API, pushState(), replaceState(), Router module, Routes, Router outlet, Router link, Route parameter</p>
	
	<h4>What is Single Page Application?</h4>
    <p>A web application that fits on one page, it's downloaded along with all the required assets when the browser requests it from the server. 
      If the browser needs to render a different view then only data in the form of JSON or XML files are sent back.</p>
