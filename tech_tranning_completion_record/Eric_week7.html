    <h4>Provide a definition for MVVM:</h4>
    <p>Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.</p>
	
	<h4>Provide three ways a component can get hold of its dependencies:</h4>
    <p> The component can create the dependency, typically using the new operator.
        The component can look up the dependency, by referring to a global variable.
        The component can have the dependency passed to it where it is needed.</p>
	
	<h4>Among the three options, which is the most favorable one and why?</h4>
    <p>The component can create the dependency, typically using the new operator.</p>
	
	<h4>What is DI, and role(s) does it involve？</h4>
    <p>	Dependency	Injection	
        Software	design	pattern	that	implements	
        inversion	of	control	for	resolving	dependencies
      </p>
	
	<h4>Provide some examples of Angular Router Terms:</h4>
    <p>Router	Module
           – {path:	“/home”,	component:	HomeComponent}
       routerOutlet
           – <router-outlet></router-outlet>
       routerLink
           – <a	routerLink=“/menu”>Menu</a></p>
	
	<h4>What is Single Page Application?</h4>
    <p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. 
      The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.</p>
