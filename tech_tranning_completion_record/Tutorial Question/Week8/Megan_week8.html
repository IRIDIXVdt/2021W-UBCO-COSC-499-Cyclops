    <h4>1. Provide a definition of Reactive Forms:</h4>
    <p>We explicitly manage the data flow between non-UI data model and a UI-oriented form model.
	This means creating a tree of angular form control objects within the component class instead of
	putting all form controls in the HTML template. This tree is binded to elements in the template 
	file.</p>
	
<h4>2. List Reactive Form Classes with its functionality</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>FormControl: individual form controls, tracks form values and validation status</li>
		<li>FormGroup: group of FormControls</li>
		<li>AbstractControl: abstract base class for the form control classes</li>
		<li>FormArray: numerically indexed array of AbstractControl instances</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>3. List Form Control Properties with its Description</h4>
    <p>for checking form control values</p>
	<ol>
		<li>.value: value</li>
		<li>.status: valid, invalid, pending, disabled</li>
		<li>.pristine/.dirty: true if user did not change the value/true if value changed</li>
		<li>true if user has not interacted with control/true if user has interacted with control</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>4. Provide a definition of RxJS</h4>
    <p>a library that angular uses to provide a reactive way of writing angular applications, used for
	composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences</p>
	
	<h4>5. Provide a definition The Observer Pattern</h4>
    <p>The observer pattern is a software-engineering pattern. this is where there are observables, which are 
	    many different streams, observers can subscribe to an observeable, which is when they can so it's 
	    notified of any changes of that observeable .
