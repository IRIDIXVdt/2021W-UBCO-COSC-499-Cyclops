    <p>A dependency can be created, you can look up and use a dependency, and lastly you can pass on a dependency
</p>
	
	<h4>Among the three options, which is the most favorable one and why?</h4>
    <p>It's easiest if you can look up a dependency, saving you the work of having to create one. Also can reuse that dependency again
</p>
	
	<h4>What is DI, and role(s) does it involveï¼Ÿ</h4>
