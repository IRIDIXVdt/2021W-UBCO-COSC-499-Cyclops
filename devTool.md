#Unity vs Ionic

##Pros of both

##They are both cross-platform: so we only need one code base for all the platforms
	given the time and size of group for the project, I think we have to choose cross-platform development tools
  
Both of them wouldn't cost us any money to use
	Ionic is open source.
	Unity has a "personal version" available. In short, if the Cyclops is going to be non-profit, than we will be able to use it for free.

##Pros of Ionic

It is a very powerful tool for developing all platform web-apps (This is the practice of a lot of large companies when it comes to web-app development):
	UI Modules: We will have access to many built-in tools to implement functions that normally would show up in a conventional app
	Transitioning from app into a website would be easier.

##Cons of Ionic

In order to make all the rendering of the animations, we need be proficient in JavaScript and at least one of its Framworks
	The framework we choose to use have to be one of the three: Angular, React, or Vue. 
	They all have a rather steep learning curve.

##Pros of Unity

Unity is a powerful tool for rendering effects:
	We can build anmations from scratch with the various libraries Unity provides
The learning curve is less steep than JavaScript Frameworks
	C# will be the language, and it has concepts and structures similar to Java. The transition will be much easier (than a JS Framework).

##Cons of Unity

Unity is not conventionally used for a web-app
	It "probably" won't have any ready-to-use UI Modules
	There would be a higher cost to implement the website if we choose unity.
