# UBCO-COSC-499-Cyclops
The meeting notes are [here](/tree/main/MeetingNotes)

Unity vs Ionic, you can have a look at some reviews from others [here](https://www.g2.com/compare/ionic-vs-unity)

## Pros of both
### They are both cross-platform: so we only need one code base for all the platforms
###### Given the time and size of group for the project, I think we have to choose cross-platform development tools
  
### Both of them wouldn't cost us any money to use
###### Ionic is open source.
###### Unity has a "personal version" available. In short, if the Cyclops is going to be non-profit, then we will be able to use it for free.

## Pros of Ionic
### It is a very powerful tool for developing all platform web-apps (This is the practice of a lot of large companies when it comes to web-app development):
###### UI Modules: We will have access to many built-in tools to implement functions that normally would show up in a conventional app
###### Transitioning from app into a website would be easier.

## Cons of Ionic
### In order to make all the rendering of the animations, we need be proficient in JavaScript and at least one of its Framworks
###### The framework we choose to use have to be one of the three: Angular, React, or Vue. 
###### They all have a rather steep learning curve.
---
## Pros of Unity
### Unity is a powerful tool for rendering effects:
###### We can build anmations from scratch with the various libraries Unity provides
### The learning curve is less steep than JavaScript Frameworks
###### C# will be the language we use in Unity. C# has concepts and structures similar to Java. The language transition will be much easier for us.

## Cons of Unity
### Unity is not conventionally used for a web-app
###### It "probably" won't have any ready-to-use UI Modules
###### There would be a higher cost to implement the website if we choose unity.
